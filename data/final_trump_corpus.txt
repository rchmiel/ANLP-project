Miss Florida was great in her denial of Miss Pennsylvania's phoney statements.
She blows Miss Pennsylvania away- a different league ..
@MannyPacquiao was robbed in his title fight on Saturday night.
No wonder boxing is dying.
Bring back the 15 round fights.
With almost 1.3 million followers and rising really fast, everyone is asking me to critique things(and people).
Finally, I will be a critic.
Last Friday's gaffe by @BarackObama claiming that the private sector "is doing fine" is illustrative.
The Justice Department's investigation into the national security leaks is not independent.
This is a very grave situation.
Trump Tuesday--@SquawkCNBC tomorrow at 7:38 AM.

Lebron's time is now!
The @timestribune - "@EricTrump: Eyes are on Northeast Pa.
Don't believe the media stories.
OPEC and the Saudis have not been doing us any favors recently with oil outputs.
Oil should be $30/barrel.
Welcome to the new reality.
Goldman Sachs just based their new Asia Pacific chairman not in Tokyo, but Beijing..
@MittRomney is 100% right.
Sad.
@BarackObama has already exempted major oil importers on Iranian sanctions and is negotiating a waiver with China.
The Euro, put in place to hurt the U.S., is done!
-- will have less negative impact than most think.
Good news--@MittRomney is now leading in North Carolina according to @ppppolls.
Once again, @Cher tweets nonsense about @MittRomney.
She needs to stop tweeting & start worrying about some of her many problems.
Thanks to @BarackObama rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline, China has become Canada's biggest oil consumer.
China is laughing at us!
China's currency manipulation is one of our nation's greatest sovereign threats.
The yuan has appreciated 40% against our dollar since 2005.
The one positive from the plunge in household wealth is that we are in a buyer's market.
This is the time to buy!
Today is my birthday.
My wish is for our country to be great and prosperous again.

Great players in sports make the game fun to watch.
@DerekJeter has continued to impress with another amazing season.
Absolute professional.
I wonder when we will be able to see @BarackObama's college and law school applications and transcripts.
Why the long wait?
Now is the time for the @GOP to be united with the mission of electing @MittRomney this November.
Stop with the public divisions.
Today's announcement by @BarackObama on immigration was done for reelection.
He is using the office of the presidency as a campaign tool.
The U.S. needs to protect our intelligence assets, especially in China.
If the Chinese want to spy on us, then we need to return the favor.
Win a dinner with @MittRomney and me in New York this June 28th.
It's selling like hotcakes!
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM.
Always interesting.
Tune in!
I don't mind that @BarackObama plays a lot of golf.
I just wish he used it productively to make deals with Congress!
On Friday @VPBiden said that China has better cities and airports than the US.
Well what has @BarackObama done about it the last 3 years?!
Now even @BarackObama's old professors are coming out in opposition to his re-election.
Congrats to Roger Clemens, he showed great courage.
This case never should have been brought to trial.
Andy Pettitte did the right thing.
Now the Chinese are planning a war game w/ the Iranians,Syrians & Russians along Syrian coast.
Putin has no respect for our President --- really bad body language.
Congratulations to @arsenioofficial on his new late night show!
He will do really well..
@MacMiller's "Donald Trump" just hit 60 million hits.
Maybe I should go into a new business.
Now is the time to buy housing, before values have fully recovered.
In 5 years, remember I told you so.
The Amateur!
First @BarackObama was caught bowing to the Saudi King but now the President of Mexico!
Yesterday there was yet another massive intelligence leak by the @BarackObama administration.
CORRUPT--with the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, there are clearly at least two cover ups in @BarackObama's White House.
The USC should be ruling any day now on @ObamaCare.
Hopefully we will get the right result.
I look forward to playing golf with President @BarackObama someday.
Rape is a huge problem in the U.S. military.
Over 19,000 rapes last year.

Sound familiar!
Good messaging and staying on point.
Congrats to @MiamiHEAT on winning @NBA championship.
U.S. tuitions are completely out of control.
In the last 4 years, the average price has gone up by 15%.
Moody's is out to make publicity.
The $9B that @BarackObama spent in 'Stimulus' for Solar, Wind Projects created 910 total jobs, costing $9.8M each.
Watch the WH spokesman try to spin @BarackObama's rationale for using exec.

Sometimes there is justice.
A Chinese military newspaper was hacked.

The Islamists have won.
Just as I predicted, the Muslim Brotherhood has taken over Egypt.
@BarackObama never should have abandoned Mubarek.
What a statesman!
I am glad America is starting to get to know @MittRomney the way I know him.
Outrageous- @BarackObama has spent over $2.
Shock - @BarackObama's DNC Convention has a $27M deficit and events are starting to be canceled.
Unemployment has been over 8% for a record 40 straight months.
@MittRomney's election will end the @BarackObama downturn.
A "Lion's List" of Democrats are not attending @BarackObama's DNC Convention.
The Democratic Party is in turmoil.
Who's the outsourcer?
@BarackObama's campaign is using a travel company with outsourced jobs in China and India.
The Fed's actions these past 3 years could bring record high inflation in the near future.
It is terrible that @BarackObama did not appoint an independent counsel to investigate the national security leaks.
No accountability.
Wow, the Supreme Court passed @ObamaCare.
I guess @JusticeRoberts wanted to be a part of Georgetown society more than anyone knew.
The USC made a terrible decision today.
How can a requirement to buy private health insurance logically be a Government tax?!
Obamacare will bankrupt our country and lead to socialized medicine.
We must all focus now on electing @MittRomney this November.
Wind Farms are not only disgusting to look at but also cause tremendous damage to their local ecosystems.
Justice Roberts did the Republican Party and @MittRomney a great favor.
It seems that Justice Scalia originally wrote the majority on ObamaCare and Roberts then switched his position.
Had a great time with @MittRomney last night.
He is focused and ready for the battle ahead.
Lots of money was raised.
Justice Kennedy should be proud of himself for sticking to his principles, in light of Justice Roberts' bullshit!
Great news--here comes the Tea Party!
@MittRomney has received 42k donations online & raised over $4.2 million since the ObamaCare decision.
Friends of mine who are driving Cadillacs--it is becoming a very hot car--are raving about what a great job @Cadillac has done.

David Wright of the NY Mets should have been on the 1st Team All Stars.
He's having a great year.
Happy to have just passed 1.3M Twitter followers.
Love communicating with everyone daily.
Why is @BarackObama continuing to lie?
Is it legal for @BarackObama to make campaign donor calls from Air Force One?
Great poll numbers for @MittRomney just out--he is leading substantially in swing states.
I believe @BarackObama made a deal with the Saudis to increase oil production until after the election.
Tomorrow we celebrate Independence Day, America's 236th birthday.
Degenerate former Congressman Anthony Weiner is trying to make a comeback.
He is a sick & perverted man that New York does not want or need.
Wow--such sacrfices for his re-election.
@BarackObama will not vacation in Martha's Vineyard this summer.
Just as I predicted, @BarackObama is preparing a possible attack on Iran right before November.
Hypocrite!
Welcome to @BarackObama's America - 8.
I don't care what people say, I like Tom Cruise.
He works his ass off and never ever quits.
He's one of the few true movie stars.
May jobless numbers have been readjusted to 8.2%.
Today @BarackObama is in Ohio on a bus tour.
Tomorrow Pennsylvania.
How about actually running the country?
When will Pakistan apologize to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden for 6 years?!
Some "ally".
John Roberts arrived in Malta yesterday.
Maybe we will get lucky and he will stay there.
Job numbers today--- terrible!
So what else is new?
As I anticipated, Justice Roberts made the cover of Time Magazine etc.
The liberal media now loves him-- he should be ashamed.
Keep an eye on Anthony Weiner.
Weasels are hard to get rid of.
Hope and Change?
Job numbers down.
A Great 4th of July!
America a great country who's brightest days, with wise leadership, lie ahead.
When true golfers see what I do at Doral it will be the hottest club in the country.
Gotta hand it to @IvankaTrump, she loved Doral from the time we looked at it.
The Trump-Doral will be an Icon.
I am truly honored to have been chosen Statesman of the Year by the Republican Party of Sarasota County.
I'm in Scotland to open what we hope to be the greatest golf course in the world--- it's amazing.
President Obama wants @MittRomney to hand over even more past tax returns- he should when @BarackObama reveals his college applications..
Why is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?
The U-6 Unemployment Rate is over 14.9%.
ObamaCare is stopping businesses from both hiring and expanding.
The liberal media is focusing on @MittRomney's bank records.
How about reviewing @BarackObama's illegal land deal contracts with Tony Rezko?
Everyone is talking about how Trump Tower is the exterior for Wayne Enterprises in Dark Knight Rises---it's true.
What a coincidence?!
@BarackObama's campaign logo uses the same font as Cuban communist propaganda posters.
How can @BarackObama invoke Richard Nixon against @MittRomney when Obama just used Executive Privilege on Fast & Furious?!
Great to see Tony La Russa manage one last game last night.
Congratulations to the National League on winning the @MLB All-Star Game.
Today @MittRomney addressed the NAACP.
@BarackObama takes their vote for granted which is why there is such high Black unemployment.
Very strange--why do database records contradict @BarackObama and show he was only at Columbia 1 year?
Almost daily more discrepancies in @BarackObama's biography continue to arise.
Who is this guy?
Even the Left realizes that @BarackObama's policies have led to more jobs being outsourced out of this country..
Have we ever had a POTUS before @BarackObama who earned over 1/3 of his income from foreign sources and paid taxes to another country?
Back in NY from Scotland and fighting for our country to get better.
Trump International Golf Links Scotland opened to rave reviews.
Seth Meyers was terrible co-hosting with Kelly.
Marbles in his mouth-& he must stop picking at his hands--insult to the great Regis Philbin!
I wonder why @BarackObama is not going to the NAACP Convention.
Is it because he can't answer questions about 14.7% Black unemployment?
America's Olympic uniforms are manufactured in China.
Burn the uniforms!
Nasty  tactics being used by @BarackObama campaign against @MittRomney.
Must stop saying Obama is a nice man--he is not!
@BarackObama wants to see 10 yrs of @MittRomney's tax returns--tell him "ok--but we want to see your college applications first.
Think of it---20% of our country is essentially unemployed..
@BarackObama should release all his records (like other Presidents)....
A true honor.
@PressSec considers asking for @BarackObama's college transcripts a "Donald Trump question".
Penn State is doing a poor job in bringing its mess to a close.
They should be ashamed for hiding Sandusky's crimes all these years...
The Football program at Penn State should be suspended.
In his entire political career, @BarackObama has never had a tough @GOP opponent before @MittRomney.
He is a paper tiger.
For America to be great again we must have a President who has been successful and Americans can learn from on how to succeed.
My friend @TheSlyStallone lost his wonderful son Sage this weekend.
We all send Sly our love and warmest wishes.
Wife Huma wants @RepWeiner to "pull a @billclinton by giving a tell-all interview".
Unlike Clinton, Anthony is a sick puppy.
A drug free A-Rod is just an average baseball player.
What controversy?
I hope @Official1MCD is recuperating well in LA.
Get better!
He has no respect for American exceptionalism.
So much for Hope and Change.
I wonder what the answer is on @BarackObama's college application to the question: place of birth?
If @BarackObama had such a wonderful academic record why wouldn't he want to show it?
@BarackObama's college application would be very very very very interesting!
I hope @MittRomney now starts asking for any & all of @BarackObama's sealed records--it's time.
Remember how @ObamaCare did not have any tort reform?
@MittRomney needs to make @BarackObama regret that he ever asked for his tax records.
When will we see @BarackObama's passport records (sealed)?
Why would @BarackObama be spending millions of dollars to hide his records if there was nothing to hide?
For the sake of transparency, @BarackObama should release all his college applications and transcripts--both from Occidental and Columbia.
Weird--why did BarackObama Sr. fail to list @BarackObama as his son in his 1961 INS application?
Dark Knight Rises is projected to gross over $180 million this weekend.
Remember to watch for Trump Tower!
The class warfare being played by @BarackObama is the only way he can get reelected.
He can't have America focus on his horrendous record.
Why does HI Revised Statute 338-17.8 allow an HI resident who doesn't have to be US citizen to procure an official Hawaii birth certificate?
As I always said, the "Birthers" were after the truth.
Thanks to @RealSheriffJoe @BarackObama can't hide anymore.
Happy 94th birthday to Nelson Mandela!
What's more important for the American public to have?
@MittRomney's tax returns or @BarackObama's sealed records?
What recovery?
JP Morgan has readjusted Q2 growth down from 1.7% to 1.4% and Q3 to 1.5% with 2012 on a whole at 1.
John Sununu was more right than he even knew yesterday -- @BarackObama indeed needs to "learn how to be an American".
The new @BarackObama motto - "You Own Nothing, Not Even Your Own Success" ...
Columbia University stated there was a "computer error" in their system concerning @BarackObama's attendance.
Since @BarackObama is on such a "transparency" kick--how about releasing Fast & Furious info to Brian Terry's family?
I hope Bill Clinton and NEWSMAX's Chris Ruddy are enjoying their mission to Africa.
Two great people.
More $ thrown away - @BarackObama gave $20M to Amonix and praised its "success" in '10.
Irresponsible!
In the last 6 months @BarackObama has held over 100 fundraisers and not a single meeting with his Job Council..
Breitbart gets it!
Vote now--Obama should release his college application records & grades.
Some really dumb blogger for failing @VanityFair, a magazine whose ads are down almost 18% this year, said I wear a hairpiece --- I DON'T!
At least 12 dead and 50 wounded in Colorado--bring back fast trials & death penalty for mass murderers & terrorists.
Breitbart gets it!
Vote now--@BarackObama should release his college application records and grades.
I am impressed with the scam @BarackObama pulled, but the truth will come out.
Bay Bridge in San Fransisco, built in China, keeps getting worse.
Cost overruns are out of control --- China is having a field day with us!
I'll be on @foxandfriends Monday morning at 7:30 AM.
Tune in!
Weekly jobless claims are now at an astronomical 365,000.
Manufacturing sector is suffering badly.
We must do better.
The NYPD has been doing a fantastic job protecting NYC.
I hope Chief Ray Kelly is strongly considering running for mayor.
Under @MittRomney, Bain had an 80% success rate with annual returns of over 50%.
Under @BarackObama, America has added over $6T in debt.
Jay Carney won't answer reporters questions of "Why Obama won't release his college transcripts"- Come on, Jay!
Fast trial and death penalty for maniac in Colorado--- immediately pass speed up legislation.
My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing housing prices, the GDP numbers, China spreading its wealth and my stock picks..
Which campaign is possibly on the trajectory towards insolvency?
@penn_state leadership has permanently scarred & perhaps destroyed a great university.
The @Yankees acquisition of Ichiro was a smart move.
I look forward to watching him play.
I can't stress strongly enough that we are currently in a buyer's residential market.
Try to buy directly from a bank.
Remember when @BarackObama promised you could keep your coverage?
Congratulations to @BarackObama--he is the first POTUS to run trillion dollar deficits in all four years of his term!
US Gov't is on the hook for more than a third of the world's entire debt & we wonder why China & OPEC are laughing all the way to the bank!
Hope & Change--since @BarackObama has taken office, the US debt has increased by an average of $64K per taxpayer.
Amazing how fast all of Joe Paterno's friends abandoned him.
They ran for the hills.
By folding, Penn State leadership made things worse.
The deal is ridiculous & punishes the wrong people.
I hope the alumni sue to overturn.
The Federal government has $2.7T in assets & $17.5T in total liabilities plus another $4.7T in intergovernmental debt.
Have a nice day.
The Audacity of @BarackObama--the Federal Reserve purchased 61% of all debt issued by Treasury in 2011.
Killing our children's future.
Price of corn has jumped over 50%.
This will cause a jump in food prices perhaps beyond what we've ever seen.
Nasty for the economy.
I am confident when American public gets to know @MittRomney, the race will go his way.
He's honorable & successful man--polls looking good.
The @nyjets are going to have a terrific season.
@Mark_Sanchez & @TimTebow will do great things on the field.
Why has @BarackObama allowed the Muslim Brotherhood to visit the @whitehouse?
What Hope & Change!
Smart move by the Democrats to have Pres.
@billclinton play a key role in their convention.
The difference between @MittRomney and @BarackObama's campaign promises to @Israel is that Mitt will actually keep all of his..
@BarackObama bowed to the Saudi King in public--yet the Dems are questioning @MittRomney's diplomatic skills..
@BarackObama should be careful questioning @MittRomney on diplomacy--how many times has Obama apologized for our country on foreign soil?!
The US GDP in 2010 was 4.1%, down to 2% in 2011 & now 1.5%.
I guess @BarackObama's plan is not working!
The Chinese are illegally dumping bird-killing wind turbines on our shores.
Only one of many grievances--we should act.
Not only does ObamaCare have at least 21 new taxes but it will lead to a tremendous doctor shortfall.
Reckless--@BarackObama is projecting $1.2T deficit from 2012 budget & a projected $25..
@BarackObama blocked Keystone.
Now China is preparing a massive $1.5B oil deal with Canada.
Great job to Missy Franklin.
She's got a smile that can take over the world.
She's also a major talent.
Great going, Missy!
The polling numbers for 2012 are very interesting--will Americans ultimately want their leaders to be 'likeable' or 'competent'?
Another example of @BarackObama's diplomatic triumphs--he gave the Queen of England an iIPod filled with his speeches.
Attended last night's @Yankees game--Derek Jeter is both a great player and a great guy.
Enjoying the Olympics.
Great coverage by @NBC as well.
GO TEAM USA!
You pick it!
No member of Congress should be eligible for re-election if our country's budget is not balanced---deficits not allowed!
Consumer spending is continuing to fall with weak June numbers..
@MichaelPhelps--you are the greatest Olympic champion of them all.
Fantastic job!
The American gymnastic team was great--our country should take their lead..
The deficits under @BarackObama are the highest in America's history.
Why is he bankrupting our country?
Congratulations to @tedcruz on his Texas primary victory last night.
He will be an outstanding Senator.
The U.S. manufacturing sector has suffered its greatest order losses under @BarackObama.
He has stood idle while China steals our jobs.
So generous and pious!
After spending millions of our tax dollars on his campaign through travel, @BarackObama donated to himself.
We need a President who understands the economy - @gallupnews has US unemployment at 8.
Great new ad from @CmteForIsrael: 'Next Year...
New job numbers once again show no growth or recovery.
Unemployment has been over 8% for 41 straight months--now up to 8.
Over 150,000 more of our fellow Americans dropped out of the workforce in July.
@BarackObama is a disaster!
Congratulations to Gabby Douglas on winning the Gold for the USA in gymnastics.
She is terrific!

Makes us proud to be Americans.
An 'extremely credible source' has called my office & told me that @BarackObama applied to Occidental as a foreign student--think about it!
An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud.
An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama bought his house with the help of Tony Rezko..
@MittRomney will create 2 million new jobs if elected POTUS.
If reelected, @BarackObama will create over $12T in new debt.
Easy choice.
The Fed should not do another 'stimulus.
' We can't keep spending our children's future away on waste.
The Senate should be more concerned about actually passing a budget than spreading lies about @MittRomney's taxes.
Glad to hear Clint Eastwood endorsed @MittRomney.
He understands that America needs a big boost to be strong again.
I went to @MikeTyson's play.
Now China 'calls in' US diplomats to lecture them on their illegal escapades.
The @whitehouse has 'clarified' that the unemployment is actually 8.254% not 8.
I have founded and run one of the largest real estate empires in the world.
I employ thousands of people.
Why am I the enemy?
To the geniuses at 'Americans United for Change': the more you tax me the less people I employ.
Get it?
Glad to hear that @FLGovScott will be speaking at the @RNC Convention.
He is a true conservative and fantastic governor!
A 'confidential source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama has added over $6T to the new national debt &  ruined US credit.
I am honored that @BarackObama has featured my plane in one of his attack ads.
It was made in America!
Glad that @MittRomney is hitting @BarackObama on ending work requirements for welfare.
Obama attacks the American work ethic.
Looking forward to meeting the great folks of Sarasota GOP party when I am honored as 'Statesman of the Year.
' Should be a wonderful time.
People are finally beginning to hit China and OPEC.
They never give me credit for being the first--by far--but that's okay!
@HuffingtonPost is doing very badly.
Also, very inaccurate stories.
Like AOL, when will they fail?
The NYPost reports "@VanityFair Magazine dropped 18% to only 283,938 newsstand copies sold".
Very sad & their bloggers are doing even worse!
Our major airports are decaying.
It's embarrassing.
We need to have them renovated by competent professionals--and fast.
I always enjoy being interivewed on @WOR710 by John Gambling.
My father Fred used to listen to his father's show.
No surprise that China was caught cheating in the Olympics.
That's the Chinese M.O. - Lie, Cheat & Steal in all international dealings..
@BarackObama-Hood: Rob our children's future by borrowing from the Chinese to pay for socialist programs that will bankrupt us.
To all struggling young entrepreneurs--stay positive in this tough climate and keep looking for good deals.
They are out there.
Have you been to the @TrumpGrill in the Trump Tower Atrium?
Best meatloaf in the City--my mother's famous recipe.
I wonder if @BarackObama ever had an Indonesian passport.
Did he become an Indonesian citizen when he lived there?
The brand new season of @CelebApprentice starts filming in less than 5 weeks.
The 'All Star' cast will be announced very soon.
Even more @BarackObama crony capitalism & corruption..
@MacMiller's 'Donald Trump' song is at 64.
Just letting China know in advance that the USA will win the medal count in the Olympics.
Even with your cheating you can't beat us.
Waste.
With 22 new taxes & $1...
Received a beautiful letter from Joe Paterno's son, Jay.
He really loved and respected his father.
The Penn State Board should resign based on the grossly incompetent way they handled the NCAA.
All recent Presidents have released their transcripts.
What is @BarackObama hiding?
China is cooking up conspiracy theories that the Olympics are rigged.
The failing New York Daily News knowingly incorrectly reported that I wanted to speak at the Republican National Convention--wrong!
As we told the @nydailynews, I was asked to speak at the RNC but said no, because I will be doing something much bigger--just watch!
I will be speaking the night before the RNC in Sarasota, FL, when I receive the "Statesman of the Year" award.
SUN newspaper/Scotland reports that "Tourism jump is thanks to Trump"..
@lolojones given a raw deal in @nytimes story--not fair.
Our airports are Third World--horrible.
Let's rebuild them by people who know how to do it--inexpensively.
Congratulations to our great Women's Olympic Soccer team @ussoccer on their gold medal.
They made us all proud!
Waste--@BarackObama's Dep.
Over 2 million people have lost their jobs since @BarackObama became POTUS.
How many of them still have healthcare?
Monday morning 7:30 AM I'll be on @foxandfriends.
Tune in!
Today @BarackObama will borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends from China.
Just another day at the office.
The Chicago machine is scared.
@PaulRyanVP shows that @MittRomney will run on a conservative & coherent platform.
Trump Chicago was featured in Transformers 3.
Trump Tower was featured in Dark Knight Rises.
Both are summer blockbusters.
Obama Care stole more then $500M from Medicare.
Congratulations to our Olympic team for by far winning the most medals, including first place gold.
Now is the time to buy a house if you can DIRECTLY from a bank.
They want to get rid of all their foreclosures.
Today I am working on my 'big surprise' for the @RNC convention.
Everyone will love it.
Glad to hear @GovChristie will be delivering the Keynote for the @RNC convention.
He will deliver a strong message.
By the US winning the Olympic medal count, we proved that both the American spirit & talent is greater than a 1.4B population.
USA!
Every sports fan is treated to an All Star game.
The loyal and growing fan base of @CelebApprentice will be getting a much bigger treat!
The Euro is going to collapse soon.
Cross border lending is already down and banks are stopping their Euro investments..
@BarackObama is promoting ugly, inefficient, unreliable, bird-killing, noisy, neighborhood-destroying wind turbines.
Big mistake.
Nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy--a disaster for taxpayers.
While @JoeBIden is a gaffe machine, yesterday's comments that @MittRomney will "put y'all back in chains" was not at all proper.
Congratulations to @AllenWest on winning last night's primary!
Lightweight reporter Alex Pareene @pareene is known as a total joke in political circles.
Hence, he writes for Loser Salon.
I'm really glad that @MittRomney no longer says what a nice guy @BarackObama is.
Richard Mourdock--a very good man running for the Senate in Indiana.
Hopefully, he will win!
Scary thought--what is the pervert Anthony Weiner doing with all the free time he has.
Does he collect unemployment?
I have hired renowned golf course architect Gil Hanse to rebuild The Blue Monster at Doral.
My acquisition of the Doral in Maimi will be a major success for the Trump Organization.
The re-building is on schedule.
I have always done well with properties fronting on oceans, lakes and rivers.
If something works, stay with it.
Congratulations to Linda McMahon on her victory in the Connecticut Senate primary.
She is an amazing woman--smart as you get!
$716 Billion from Medicare by @BarackObama.
When will it end?
Chelsea Clinton will be very successful in the world of politics.
She's always been a great person--a winner.
The @Lakers should have an amazing team next year with Kobe, Nash and Howard.
Will be fun to watch.
One of the hardest jobs in politics must be cleaning up after @JoeBiden gaffes.
I feel sorry for his spokespeople.
Military reps have attacked @BarackObama over Bin Laden leaks--they believe he's just using this for his benefit.
Not a big surprise...
The Huffington Post is such a loser--it will die just as AOL is dying, What a stupid deal AOL made to buy it!
What's more dangerous for the country--the Iranian nuclear threat or @BarackObama as President?
I wonder what the work atmosphere is like @VanityFair.
It must be hard working at a dying institution.
There's only only one person who has defunded Medicare.
His name is @BarackObama.
Congratulations to @WWERaw on passing 1,000 episodes.
@WWE is still going strong after all these years--@VinceMcMahon is great!
I still hold the all-time attendance and pay per view record at @WWE.
There are only 22 days for @BarackObama to drop @JoeBiden.
Obama is not a loyal guy.
I think he is strongly considering it.
Jennifer Aniston is engaged--she's a great person and I wish her well..
@Israel could very well be close to attacking Iran.
Could be this election's big October surprise...
I always said @BarackObama will attack Iran, in some form, prior to the election.
Palm Springs, CA has been destroyed--absolutely destroyed--by the world's ugliest wind farm at the Gateway on Interstate 10.
Very very sad!
Wind farms are killing many thousands of birds.
They make hunters look like nice people!
@MittRomney shouldn't give additional tax returns until @BarackObama gives his passport records, college records & applications @BarackObama is hiding plenty of bad things.
The country of Georgia is a small wonder.
Performing well economically under the leadership of @SaakashviliM.
A great American ally..
Great sign:"We built this business without government help.
Obama can kiss our a--"!
@MittRomney & @PaulRyanVP get what needs to be done to reign in China.
@BarackObama gets kicked around by the Chinese.
The US government's foreign debt is at a record $5.
US government's foreign indebtedness has grown over 72% under @BarackObama.
He is bleeding us dry to China.
If @BarackObama really loved this country, he wouldn't be destroying it.
He has ruined our credit and killed jobs with ObamaCare.
Congratulations to @bobmcdonnell on leading Virginia to be in the black for a 3rd straight year.
He is a fantastic governor.
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM--tune in!
Oil is rising back over $100 barrel.
OPEC loves to rip us off.
Why shouldn't they--they always get away with it.
Scary thought--@JoeBiden is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.
Why are we continuing to train these Afghanis who then shoot our soldiers in the back?
Afghanistan is a complete waste.
Time to come home!
@Rosie, get better fast.
I'm starting to miss you!
Congratulations to Billy Payne and  @AugustaNational on doing the right thing.
If you have any doubt that @BarackObama must be defeated see @DineshDSouza's '2016: Obama's America.
' Amazing film!
In less than a week I'll be honored by  Sarasota GOP as Statesman of the Year & then give my big surprise to @RNC convention.
Will be fun!
We have to get tough with China before they destroy us.
Glad to hear that @JimTalent has put some strong anti-China referendums in the @GOP convention platform.
It's Tuesday..
@RogerJStoneJr was great on @TheKudlowReport last night.
Roger and Larry are good friends!
Amazing--both Transformers & Dark Knight Rises featured Trump properties and each grossed over $1B.
Just coincidence.
Every economic climate, whether an uptick or downturn, presents new opportunities and challenges.
Distressed real estate opportunities can make great investments.
You need the foresight and instincts to know the property's true potential.
Glad to hear @BarackObama's attack ad featuring my plane is playing in North Carolina.
Free ad time for Trump National in Charlotte!
Only three weeks until the new season of @CelebApprentice begins filming--great all-star cast.
I am tired of @BarackObama talking about @MittRomney's father.
Why don't we discuss Barack Obama Sr.!
It's amazing how many people still come up to me to thank me for 'The Art of The Deal.
' The book has changed a lot of lives.
Many people will be surprised at what is about to be released concerning @BarackObama's background.
I, for one, won't be..
My shirts, ties and fragrance are doing "great" at @Macys--try them!
Make fantastic gifts..
@BarackObama was caught telling Russian PM @MedvedevRussiaE that he can be more 'flexible' in his second term.
Russia thinks he's weak.
Gas prices are soaring.
$4.12 in CA.
OPEC is laughing at how stupid we are.
Putin just sent a Russian nuclear sub to the Gulf of Mexico.
@BarackObama can't be bothered, he is too concerned with @MittRomney's taxes.
We are about to have a record $500B trade deficit with the Chinese this year.
That money should be back here financing jobs in America.
Congratulations to @Yankees Derek Jeter on passing Eddie Murray last night to become the 11th all-time @MLB hit leader..
@EdRendell's book, "A Nation of Wusses" is an excellent read--especially page 10.
Go get it!
Can't wait to meet patriotic small business owners next week in Sarasota and Tampa!
Hey @BarackObama, We Did Build It!
@BarackObama said he doesn't take the Navy Seals campaigning against him "too seriously".
It's Wednesday.
I wonder how much money @BarackObama borrowed from China today?
Here's a sneak peek at the @DNC convention theme:  "It's not our fault.
Blame Bush.
Oh, and government built it".
One of the best moves I made early in my career was buying the air rights from Tiffany's flagship.
Trump Tower gleams over Fifth Avenue.
It's sad to see once decent newspapers like @USAToday failing so badly.
I just don't know if they can be saved.
Today we just passed 1.4 million twitter followers..
It's Thursday.
I wonder how much money @BarackObama drained from Medicare today to finance ObamaCare.
It is truly an honor that His Eminence Archbishop of New York @CardinalDolan will be delivering the benediction at the @RNC convention.
Wind turbines are a scourge to communities and wildlife.
They are environmental disasters.
In any business venture, remember that branding is one of the most crucial aspects of your enterprise.
Fight hard for that brand of yours.
Amazing--@VanityFair survived one more day without folding.
The clock is ticking...
Massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism pread shots out over long period and watch positive result..
The independent watchdog who exonerated @BarackObama for the failed green energy loans just donated $52,500 to Obama's campaign.
A hurricane will be coming to Tampa.
My @RNC convention surprise hits Monday night!
The Muslim brotherhood is sending tanks into the Sinai & saying it doesn't violate Camp David accord.
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood President is visiting us next month.
@BarackObama is so excited.
I am very surprised that @lancearmstrong gave up.
I never thought he was a quitter....
@lancearmstrong should immediately reconsider or his legacy is ruined.
Dishonest reporters knowingly write lies that I said, “children should not get vaccinated”.
Terrible tragedy at the Empire State Building today.
Must have fast trials and death penalty for the animals..
@BarackObama is bankrupting this country.
His budget adds another $4.4T to the debt, putting us over $20T in total debt by 2016.
I am proud of the Tea Party.
These great patriots have accomplished so much in strengthening our country in only 3 short years.
Here is a letter I received yesterday from someone who has had personal experience with our health care situation.
Life brings you many surprises.
As a child I used to vacation with my family at the Doral in Miami.
Now I own it.
Florida has been very good to me.
I am really esxcited to give back at the Sarasota GOP event and @RNC convention.
Will be fun!
@DineshDSouza's '2016: Obama's America' is expanding to over 1,000 theaters this weekend.
Will be highest grossing documentary in 2012.!!
It's Friday.
How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today?
They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.
I am sure the @NCGOP will do a great job bracketing the @DNC convention.
They are a tremendous statewide organization..
@BarackObama sent over 100,000 jobs and Canadian oil to China all because he would not approve Keystone XL..
@BarackObama is begging the Eurozone to keep Greece in until after 11.6.12.
He thinks the world revolves around his re-election.
Why do the Republicans keep apologizing on the so called "birther" issue?
No more apologies--take the offensive!
I knew Chris Matthews when he was sane and, quite honestly, wonderful.
Now he's gone off the deep end as an Obama surrogate.
One point I made last night and will continue to push is that the @GOP can't be pollitically correct.
We must fight fire with fire.
Sorry to hear of the passing of Neil Armstrong over the weekend.
He was an American hero.
It is very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA.
He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians..
@BarackObama has completely failed the American people.
Media silent when @BarackObama  called @MittRomney a murderer & felon.
Mitt mentions 'birth certificate' and they go nuts.
Double standard!
As usual, the weather people got it wrong in Tampa.
They just look for headlines & ratings!
The US Navy wants to go "green".
Our Navy should use the best & most powerful fuel & not play games.
Give me a break!
@ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out.
I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.
Don't think my statement on @ariannahuff was harsh, if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand--- more to follow.
The Bay Bridge in San Francisco is being built by the Chinese--tremendous cost overruns.
A total mess..
@RobinRoberts everyone adores you- including me- get well fast!
Ask China if their rapidly expanding (with our money) Navy or Armed Forces are going "green" -- They would laugh in your face!
Remember when @ariannahuff ran for Governor of California.
She got 3 votes.
Happy to hear that @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom chapters are at the @RNC convention supporting @MittRomney.
We must be united to win!
@MELANIATRUMP and I are looking forward to watching @AnnDRomney's speech tonight.
She is an amazing woman who will be a great First Lady!
@GovChristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @MittRomney  should be elected and @BarackObama has to go.
It's Tuesday--how much inflation has @BarackObama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas?
I can't wait to read this...
I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed.
We must take care of our seniors..
@BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November.
China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November.
They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama.
Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night.
America can't wait to call her our First Lady.
Great speech by my good friend @GovChristie.
He did something you won't hear at @BarackObama's convention---tell the truth.
It's Wednesday, how much money is China stealing from us today?
I am astonished that the media continues to lie.
@BarackObama gutted welfare reform.
It is a fact!
I was putting together my early deals in New York & I was advised by many that I was too young.
Believe in yourself & you can do anything.
It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?
Gas prices are way too high.
With an economy contracting and lower demand, how do OPEC & the speculators get away with this?!
Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice.
We really have something amazing for the fans this year.
Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech.
Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better.
The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!
I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech.
Joe should call in sick for the VP debate.
Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie.
I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
Too busy playing golf?
Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment.
Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech.
Chris has completely lost it.
A fact--golfers don't get aches & pains like others who don't golf.
It is amazingly remedial.
It's Friday, how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today?
Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend.
@BarackObama could have stopped this.
I loved watching Clint Eastwood last night--he was terrific!
@MittRomney's entire life and career have  built  prosperity and growth..
@GovMikeHuckabee was great the other night.
People love him.
We have all the cards.
Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran.
I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious.
They watch the polls.
@MittRomney won't let them cheat us anymore..
@BarackObama's assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China".
Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama.
Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC!
Andy Roddick...
a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife.
Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy.
When will they learn that he is not?
If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame, liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible!
I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad...
leave Clint alone!
Great going Andy Roddick!
Another victory for a fabulous player.
Brooklyn Decker is good luck.
As I predicted 1 year ago, gasoline prices hit a record high today...
OPEC is having a ball at our expense.
Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal--and commissioned the one sided report.
Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane?
He is more than welcomed to come for a ride.
Is this Hope & Change?
A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June.
We must do better.
Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres.
Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote.
The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info.
Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb.
Lots of $'s being made on us.
With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention, @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents.
Scary.
NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama, 0% @MittRomney.
Even worse than Hillary's old numbers.
Is that racism?
The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago.
They have stolen even more from us in jobs & trade during @BarackObama's term.
OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago.
Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term.
Outrageous!
What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?
July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months.
Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year.
No surprise.
Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud!
@lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous--he is no Lance.
Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon, @lancearmstrong, for events that took place years ago in France?
@lancearmstrong, revise your decision to quit--go back and fight.
With all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @DNC convention yesterday, it was ironic that the debt passed $16T..
@serenawilliams is a special player.
Almost every T.V. show is asking me to go on--especially the @Late_Show.
It's simple--I get the ratings!
I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now.
North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people.
I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte.
Better off?
The $16T US debt works out to $136,260 per household, a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office.
The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform.
Not good!
Scary thought--is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte?
Did he bring his phone with him?
Other networks are begging me to do a show--I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice!
Bill Clinton did a great job last night--the Democrats are lucky to have him.
Do you really believe he likes @BarackObama?
Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace.
Thank you, United States, for making this possible!
Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium.
Pretty convenient.
The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting "Four More Years".
Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?
After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released.
Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan.
Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America's history, he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt.
Under @BarackObama, 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps.
The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia.
He will take votes away from @MittRomney.
Dems had a very good and professional convention.
The Republicans must be smart and tough--and fast!
Drew Peterson, a real sleaze, just convicted of killing wife.
Change the law so he gets death penalty.
Today's job report is dismal.
Now a record 88,921,000 Americans are no longer in the work force.
There are now 119,000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July.
The economy is still terrible.
Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work.
If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.
A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC.
Next week we start filming the record 13th season Hence, go with your gut!
During @BarackObama's presidency, median family income has fallen 4.
One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom.
But I used the downturn to my advantage.
I'll be on @foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM.
Tune in!
Obama asked a 7 yr old for his birth certificate.
He's "in your face" because the Republicans dropped the ball.
Why has Barack Obama repeatedly told inconsistent stories about his religious background?
Obama called August's job report "progress".
Today we remember and honor our fellow Americans and NYPD and FDNY who fell 11 years ago.
On this solemn day of remembrance we can all take joy in the fact that Bin Laden's last sight was a Navy SEAL pulling the trigger.
The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers & their union.
Inexcusable to leave children without school.
Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration?
Where's the media?
Time to get out of there.
Why won't Obama release his college applications?
Is there something 'foreign' about them?
China is an international pariah.
Amazing.
@CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base.
I hope the @GOP realizes that if they blow this election the Tea Party won't be with them next time.
Why is the Pentagon wasting precious dollars on going 'green.
' Complete waste.
We need the best & easiest fuel for our military.
When will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election?
The day after.
We fight to free Libya and they kill our Ambassador and other Americans.
Obama's foreign policy is a joke.
An attack on our Embassy is an attack on our soil.
We have been attacked by Libya.
Obama doesn't know what he's doing.
His foreign policy is a disaster.
I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news.
Once again, I was right.
Libya is selling its oil to China--I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe.
Obama is a disaster at foreign policy.
Never had the experience or knowledge.
He is not capable of doing the job.
The Middle East is blowing up--we didn't back Egypt and now they riot against us.
As bad as they were, I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power.
What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador.
Demand their oil.
It's Wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?
OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas.
They are always ripping us off.
So Obama can host the Muslim Brotherhood Pres.
Obama will go down as the worst President in history on many topics but especially foreign policy.
No surprise.
I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out.
The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11.
Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing?
Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President.
Obama=Carter.
Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP.
If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013.
Weakness, cow towing and not standing firm is provocative.
We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President.
This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President.
We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy.
Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble.
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.
With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food.
Romney’s campaign is being put on the defensive.
He cannot let this happen.
Stop pandering.
If Obama was smart, he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month.
He won't.
Wake Up America!
Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started.
Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates.
Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally.
They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?!
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
The media is pathetic.
Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
I will be speaking Monday, September 24,  (10 A.M.) at Liberty University, to a record setting student body.
I look forward to it!
Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
It's Thursday, how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney?
Obama's convention bounce is gone..
@MittRomney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue.
Obama, who put these radicals in power, deserves blame.
Congratulations to Obama and the @DNC.
WOW!
I just heard that the previously unknown singer Mac Miller has received over 67 million hits on his song "Donald Trump".
I hate @USAToday's redesign--the logo is terrible.
Lightweight Al Neuharth must've had something to do with this No wonder paper is failing.
Oh no, another rapper doing a Trump song --"Young Jeezy - Trump Lyrics".
Why aren't these guys paying me?
It's amazing--@hardball_chris has completely lost all connections to reality.
He is a complete shill for Obama.
Why doesn't Obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in Egypt have live ammunition?
They need it fast.
QE3 is going to further sink the dollar into oblivion.
Creates artificial numbers for short term market gains.
First Obama says Egypt is not an ally.
If you want to know how to prevail through tough circumstances then read "The Art of the Comeback".
Hey @KimKardashian--I hear you are undecided in the election.
I can explain why you should vote for @MittRomney.
Weekly jobless claims are up once again.
The economy cannot recover with Obama in office.
Occupy Wall Street is at it again- go out and get a job.
It's actually easier work and far more rewarding.
Kate Middleton is great--but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude--only herself to blame.
After being ripped off for years, Obama finally figured out that China is taking advantage of us.
He's finally listening to me.
Obama is our unlucky President.
Everything he touches turns into a mess.
Some people just don't have it!
Gas prices have doubled under Obama.
Over $5/gallon now in California.
We must start drilling from our own resources to become independent.
Teachers in Chicago should go back to work immediately.
Rahm Emanuel has offered them a fair deal.
Now they're just acting for the cameras.
Eli Manning staged a great comeback in 4th quarter--an elite quarterback.
Still a buyer's market.
Buy directly from a bank.
They want to offload properties that have defaulted, will give good prices & financing.
It's Monday, how many more excuses will Obama make today about the economy?
I'll be at Liberty University Monday, 10 AM, for speech.
Looking forward to meeting students--all sold out!
With 49 days until the election, @MittRomney needs to stay on offense.
He should not be apologizing.
Deflect onto Obama's record.
The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran.
It's Tuesday.
How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster.
Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments..
@lightjzup  Industrial turbines are destroying our land..
@RICKYMONEY  I don't know a lot about failures.
And as you know, I never went bankrupt.
Can you believe--they are blaming @MittRomney for Egypt.
Obama killed over 100k jobs by not approving Keystone XL pipeline and Canada is now selling the oil to China--very dumb!
Filming for @CelebApprentice Season 13 is now into the 2nd week.
The 'All-Star' cast is already hard at work.
Obama should play golf with Republicans & opponents rather than his small group of friends.
That way maybe the terrible gridlock would end.
The stage is set for the real debate--it will be very interesting!
Technology has shown we have tremendous energy resources right under our feet that we didn't know about 5 years ago.
Oil would be $25 a barrel if our government would let us drill.
Our country would be rich again--who needs OPEC.
Don't let them build a wind turbine in your backyard (or near your house).
It will destroy your property value.
China has been unfairly subsidizing the export of cars & auto parts.
I've been saying this for 3 years come down hard--tax the hell out of their imports and reduce our deficit fast.
QE3, a political favor for Obama, will cause record inflation on food and fuel.
This hits low income families the hardest.
Big mistake.
Isn’t it great that Obama had time yesterday to fundraise with Jay Z and do @Late_Show while there is a record 21% real unemployment!
To be successful, never give up.
My secrets to success will be shared at the National Achievers Congress in London.
It is now clear that the Embassy attack in Libya was a coordinated Al Qaeda operation and not based on some video.
Obama's Def.
Sec..
I really like Chelsea Clinton--an amazing young woman.
She got the best of both parents.
Watch--yesterday Obama continued to evade questions on his security failures in the Benghazi consulate attack.
I have fun, I love what I do.
You should too.
Find out how at the National Achievers Conference this October....
but interestingly, the same people seem to be lucky.
No matter how diligent you are in evaluating a business deal there is invariably one factor you have no control over--luck...
I'll be on @foxandfriends Monday at 7:30 AM.
Tune in!
A letter written to one of my many critics!
The Ryder Cup will be amazing this week.
Just left Liberty University.
Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.& his father have done an amazing job...
Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records & applications in return?
The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials.
They must be tough and smart.
With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
The Emmys were horrendous...
the absolute worst show!
The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over.
All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats.
They want to influence public perception of the race.
Despite all of China's cheating, they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential!
The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11.
Time for Obama to come clean.
With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value.
Today I spoke @LibertyU Convocation, a great crowd...
Scary--Obama's budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends.
Secure your place at the National Achievers Congress in London.
It will be an amazing event with a great surprise.
The debates are going to have a big impact on the election.
@MittRomney has proved--in Florida--he delivers under pressure.
Home values have sunk a record 15% under Obama.
Coincidence?
Muslim Brotherhood head of Egypt Morsi is already making demands on Obama before the WH visit.
Obama's foreign policy is a complete failure.
Emmys telecast is way down & lowest telecast on record among young adults.
Emmys have no credibility-Should have nominated Apprentice again!
Thousands of great people showed up from Liberty University yesterday.
I love standing ovations!
One 57 is one of the worst looking buildings I've seen in a long time, in particular its very ugly "skin".
The replacement refs are getting blamed for everything.
I've seen many bad sports calls over the years.
Did a shoot in front of the Metropolitian Museum on 5th Ave for the 13th season of the Apprentice well into our 4th week of shooting the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice.
The 'All Stars' are hard at work yet not one meeting with an ally (or an enemy!
) Where's the media?
Obama will be going on @theviewtv & fundraising while in NYC for the UN Assembly...
The 18th hole at the Blue Monster @Doral in Miami is considered the toughest finishing hole in golf......
Never let yourself be pushed around--but treat the good folks great....
One point I made sure to stress at @LibertyU is to be sure to get even with anyone who crosses you...
The number of unemployed Americans has increased over 60% during Obama's term.
The economy can't survive another 4 years.
English taxpayers should stop subsidizing the destruction of Scotland by paying massive subsidies for ugly wind turbines.
Andy Williams has died.
He was a friend of mine and a great guy..
@brandonhardest  Love what you do and work hard.
Obama's new excuse for his failures is that you "can't change Washington from the inside".
Not what he said in '09.
Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years.
He can never take responsibility.
Aspirin gets the best press of almost anything I can think of---fact or great PR?
@Matt_Berry87  Piers did a great job--the interview was very important.
Pres.
Housing prices will be going up big league--a great time to buy--good luck!
China is filling the vacuum left by Obama at the UN on the world stage.
China has done very well under Obama.
Now they just released their first aircraft carrier.
No matter how good the replacement refs do, they will be soundly criticized--they can't win!
Huff post gets it wrong re: Ferry Point...
the only leakage of gas is from Arianna Huffington.
Associated Press knowingly and inaccurately wrote about Liberty University speech.
Shameful reporting...
no credibility.
Liberty University speech by DJT was biggest by far in school's history.
Standing ovations...
great young people!
Jerry Falwell, Jr. stated speech was best in University's history...
my great honor.
Just bought the Kluge Estate in Charlottesville, Virginia (don't worry, only business)..
@EricTrump did an amazing job raising money for @StJude with his @EricTrumpFDN event featuring  @LisaLampanelli.
Crunch time.
@MittRomney must stay on offense and take the fight to Obama.
Congratulations to my friend David Wright of the @mets who is now their all-time hitting leader.
How long will it take for chants-- "bring back the replacement refs" -- when a bad call is made?
Does Madonna know something we all don't about Barack?
At a concert she said "we have a black Muslim in the White House".
I hope the @RNC is ready for a Third Party if they blow this election because that is what they will face.
They must fight hard.
I have fun, I love what I do.
You should too.
A resort in Arizona is using sewage to make snow.
Environmentalists are going crazy--I won't be skiing in that snow.
ObamaCare is a failure.
Costs are rising much faster under Obama than other Presidents.
China's Financial Institutions are expanding overseas..
@MittRomney must ask for Obama's college records & applications--why is he not doing this?
Someone must be fired at @AOL for that stupid deal they made buying Huffington Post.
Are you a young professional getting ready for a big meeting?
Iraq was one of our biggest mistakes.
We got absolutely nothing for our sacrifices.
Keep the big picture in mind.
There are always opportunities & possibilities, & thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
Be tenacious.
Being tenacious means you're tough and patient at once, so it's a formidable combination..
@LisaLampanelli  You are terrific (always).
Great job on the Apprentice.
Obama is not working.
US Manufacturing orders fell a record 13.9% in August.
Where's the recovery?
The @rydercup is currently going on--and is one of the truly great sporting events.
My successful acquisition of the Kluge estate was a fantastic deal which is already being studied in business schools.
It's amazing how different all of the polling results are--not an exact science.
Brits spent $57.8M on the royal family.
Obamas cost us $1..
@IsraeliPM @netanyahu delivered an excellent speech yesterday at the UN.
Too bad @AmbassadorRice wasn't there.
Sean's interview with Bob Woodward on @hannityshow was very interesting--Woodward was great.
If you live in a state with early voting, you should be voting as soon as possible.
Bring your friends and family with you.
Obama lied to the public about the Al Qaeda attack on our consulate in Libya.
He should be held accountable.
Cyberattack on White House--- what's next?
In debate, @MittRomney should ask Obama why autobiography states "born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia".
Only 36 days until the election.
@MittRomney needs to stay on offense.
Make Obama's terrible record the issue.
Republicans and @MittRomney must get tough very soon.
Obama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden.
The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers.
How many more of our soldiers have to be shot by the Afghanis they are training?
Obama now wants to give another $450M to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Money we don't have going to people that hate us.
Moronic.
Big cancer risk from new "environmental" light bulbs"--a big price to pay!
Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez said in a television interview that aired on Sunday "If I were American, I'd vote for Obama".
Al Qaeda taking over Libya after we made it possible--really amazing.
Obama loves wasting our money.
Glad to hear @SethMacFarlane will be hosting this year's Oscars.
Something new that should be fun.
In Nov.
Wednesday's debate is day one of the election.
Over 70 million voters will be watching.
Big win by @Yankees last night to take control of AL East.
Jeter & company now control their destiny.
The Chinese are now hacking White House computers.
Why not?
They already own the place.
Woody Johnson's comments that he would rather have @MittRomney win the election than his @nyjets win games shows real patriotism.
Under Obama, Iran has taken over Iraq, Al Qaeda has taken over Libya, the Muslim Brotherhood now controls Egypt.
Worst  foreign policy ever.
Great to hear that @nfl legend and hall of famer John Elway has endorsed @MittRomney in Colorado.
CO is a must win state for Mitt.
I'll be on @gretawire tonight on @foxnews at 10 pm.
It's Tuesday, how much will the media continue to cover up the embassy attacks for Obama?
Where is the main stream media reporting on Univision's new expose of Fast and Furious?
Too busy looking at Mitt's taxes?
The cheap 12 inch sq.
marble tiles behind speaker at UN always bothered me.
I will replace with beautiful large marble slabs if they ask me.
See June 2007 speech--is Obama a total racist?
Obama called Reverend Wright his friend, counselor & great leader--then dumped him like a dog!
Reverend Wright must have great hatred for Obama and the manner in which he was shunted aside.
My daughter Ivanka is being honored by the Wharton School of Finance with the 2012 Young Leadership Award.
I am very proud of Ivanka!
Can't wait for tonight's debate--actually delayed my trip to Europe so I can watch.
This is going to be a great night.
Who is rooting for Obama more tonight--his campaign advisors or the press?
I will be visiting Trump Int'l Golf Links in Scotland tomorrow.
Always great to see the Great Dunes of Scotland.
I'm always amazed when I travel to my foreign properties.
Seeing the Trump brand across 4 continents proves that excellence can be universal.
Obama's '07 speech which @DailyCaller just released not only shows that Obama is a racist but also how the press always covers for him.
Have you heard?
China just told Obama to jump.
Obama asked how high.
There's only one candidate who cut medicare and that's Barack Obama.
Cut over $700M to move into ObamaCare.
Congratulations to Mitt Romney.
He was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight!
As a big job creator, I was greatly honored to have been mentioned twice tonight during the debate.
Wind farms are ugly, not cost effective and don't produce worthwhile returns or energy.
No wonder governments are giving up on them..
@SethMacFarlane will be a great Oscar host.
He did an amazing job at my @ComedyCentral roast.
Both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life.
You need to stay positive.
I'm eagerly awaiting the next polls.
The debate performance could be devastating to the Obama team.
Let's see what happens.
Happy to have just passed 1.5M followers on twitter.
We picked up over 14,000 yesterday alone.
It's great to speak to everyone daily.
Congratulations to Michelle and Barack Obama on their 20th anniversary.
The upcoming season of @CelebApprentice will be terrific--a great cast.
I'll be in London on Sunday at the ExCel Centre to talk about success.
It will be a great time for everyone!
Congrats to @Yankees on finishing 1st in the AL East.
Derek Jeter is great--good luck in the playoffs!
Bill Clinton has been Obama's most effective surrogate out on the trail.
Glad to hear that @RobinRoberts is doing well.
She is a terrific person.
My friend @GovChristie called it--@MittRomney recast the race.
Now America knows--the Emperor has no clothes.
Why would Obama do better in a 2nd debate?
Looking forward to Sunday’s speech in the ExCel Centre.
More than 70M people watched the Presidential Debate.
A new record.
See what happens when I am so prominently mentioned (just kidding)!
Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts.
Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty.
I would do same thing if I were China.
They want Obama.
A record 46.
Who is more believable on the state of employment--the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for Obama?
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter.
He is in the bag for Obama.
He can't carry @jack_welch's jock.
At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate.
Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass.
He is a great guy and player.
How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?
' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours?
Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.
It is actually double that at $1.
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice.
Our fans will be pleased..
@jack_welch is correct--these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE..
@carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals.
They made a wise decision..
@ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard!
Greece should get out of the euro & go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.
California gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow.
An election-losing event for Obama.
Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use.
Also, not a pressure player.
In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens.
I like him again, a lot.
George Will is a political moron.
Last month he said Romney couldn't win.
When will the unemployment numbers be corrected?
Sadly, after the election!
Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates.
Will be a lot of fun.
With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.
He is desperate..
@DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist.
Thank you David--we are again friends.
By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night.
It will be very interesting, I promise.
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary.
Be careful!
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate.
Let's see how he reacts under pressure.
In this election, we decide whether we become great again.
I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations?
Media?
Over 23M Americans unemployed.
And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech.
The honor was all mine!
Great people.
A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win.
He simply can't perform without drugs.
I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama.
Be careful on Thursday night!
Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an "A" grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy.
Rick is a fantastic governor.
Great move to take A-Rod out of game.
Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter..
I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold.
Brutal report.
A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench.
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish.
A beater is always a beater--just watch!
I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight.
Don't be fooled by his gaffes.
He is a seasoned and feisty debater.
Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb.
Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place.
That is the real scandal.
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!
Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...
It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election.
How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today?
Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription?
Another sign that @jack_welch is right..
@Linda_McMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC.
Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
Get ready- this should be informative and fun!
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind.
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can.
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching.
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan.
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective.
Ryan must now come back and combat.
Pretty even debate- no knockouts.
However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger.
What do you think?
Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.
-- watch.
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying Scottish windmills.
ObamaCare is a complete disaster.
Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it.
Terrible.
Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.
Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night.
My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me.
I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there..
@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast.
This will be something special!
With our amazing All Star cast, @Joan_Rivers, @johnrich, @ArsenioOFFICIAL & @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families.
The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again.
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them.
Loyalty is very important.
I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod.
Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.
Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup.
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away.
Scrape and paint before too late.
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose.
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion..
@Yankees are in trouble without Derek.
Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence.
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat.
Time for him to step up and leave.
Yankees can win today.
Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.
No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either.
When I go, they win.
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke..
@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good.
One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
A-Rod is just not making it.
We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications?
Boy would that create a mess!
He is not who you think.
Barack Obama is not who you think he is.
Most overrated politician in US history.
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid.
Mitt's doing well.
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity.
He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform.
He is a $30M/yr rip off.
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator.
He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!
Based on very popular demand, I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate.
Gov.
Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote.
Obama must go!
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod.
If he doesn't perform well it could be over.
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight.
We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
Verlander is great but  very beatable..
@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice..
@antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths.
You have, in my opinion, zero talent..
@antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote & make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked.
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row.
At least he is consistent.
It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings.
And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real...
@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep..
@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.
Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President..
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.
@DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great..
@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
Get ready for tonight!
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series.
And I will go to games 6& 7 so they will win!
Great win last night by Peyton Manning & @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road.
Very impressive.
For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.
They just don't believe we would.
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country.
Very nice compliment--I agree.
Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"!
Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it?
It's all talk.
Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility.
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak.
@MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
Obama weak on immigration.
All words, no action.
He's been Prez 4 years.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton..
@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems.
Obama has no answer.
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama.
No wonder nothing gets done.
You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins.
Good night.
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other.
At one point it looked like they would come to blows.
George Will said "best debate he ever saw".
If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago.
Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated.
At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do.
I kept saying, why didn't he do it?
He lost me a long time ago.
Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...
its been lucky for you.
The day after he sold it, he broke his foot.
I still love Derek, he is a winner!
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal.
If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night?
I don't!
Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively.
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama.
Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win.
Don't put it past him!
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--& all the "biggies".
It's like having your own newspaper.
Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay.
I am a long time Yankee fan.
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities.
Remember, new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer.
Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are.
Windmills are a disaster.
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally & aesthetically.
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.
Mitt will remember the early helpers.
Obama was beaten but not knocked out.
He lives to fight another day.
But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance Bad decisions can be devastating..
@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style.
Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded.
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there.
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped.
See what happens when I am not mentioned.
Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart.
She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch.
He can do much better!
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all.
We should be given credit for taking this risk...
@antbaxter should really be ashamed about his massive box office disaster..
@mystikangel  Bring @johnrich back?
He is back!
If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them.
Major grudge match this weekend between @nyjets & @Patriots.
Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth..
@ashleycam2883 Re: Libya--Hillary took the blame for Obama.
Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future.
Does he even care?
Amazing--my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ.
Alert--US jobless claims up 46,000 to 388,000.
Really bad news.
Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion.
She will cheat again--100 certain--am I ever wrong?
Newsweek ending print edition--sad.
Now my Newsweek covers mean nothing--they lost all credibility.
TIME to follow?
A reader just sent me the following:  "I wanted to share with you something rather startling.
Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right.
If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.
I think the @yankees will win today.
Unlike A-Rod, CC is good under pressure.
I hope A-Rod plays, however.
Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins.
If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy.
Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment.
Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you.
While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars, ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.
She is back!
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states.
Their internals must be horrendous.
When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?
Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama.
I always said Bill was an honest man.
It's Thursday.
How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction.
You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape.
My Trump Home Mattress Collection by Serta is setting records--they are really phenomenal.
Hey @Rosie--how is your recovery going?
I hope you are doing well so we can start fighting again soon!
The Yankees are absolutely terrible--- what happened to this team?
Can't believe we are less than three weeks away from the election.
Time certainly flies!
I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned!
@evaemery Thanks--you sound great!
@Yankees should get rid of A-Rod ASAP--I can't watch this guy anymore!
Something really bad happened to the @Yankees psyche--much like our President!
It is a great honor to have helped the community so much.
With Barry Diller & Tina Brown in charge, did anyone doubt that @Newsweek would be a massive failure?
Great decision by Donald Graham @Newsweek to sell.
I'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall..
@MittRomney did a great job last night.
Watch the clip!
Obama said "not optimal" to Ambassador & embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate.
Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines?
Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it!
I guess they don’t have freedom of the press in Scotland..
@lancearmstrong really blew it--went down in flames--too bad!
So many tweets & stories on Stewart/Pattinson Look, it doesn't matter-- the relationship will never be the same.
It is permanently broken..
@katyperry is no bargain but I don't like John Mayer--he dates and tells--be careful Katy (just watch!
).
My interview with @IngrahamAngle discussing the real unemployment number and how the 7.
Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.
Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year.
Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC.
Obama has called Libya attack "a bump in the road" and "not optimal".
Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth!
Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead.
Mitt will pull away next week.
I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did.
You can't do any worse!
A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season.
They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner.
Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night!
Rev.
@BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney.
Rev.
@BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son, Franklin Graham.
Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on "When Rev.
Wright disciples go to Washington"?
Sad!
@VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low, even for them.
Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which, under Graydon Carter, will be sooner rather than later.
No surprise, welfare spending is up over 30% under Obama..
@MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget.
Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt.
What a surprise!
Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower.
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately.
It will be lucky for him like in past.
Good luck to Derek on his operation.
I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack.
Respect the wounded and dead.
The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go.
Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic.
Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama!
Derek, get well soon, the @Yankees need youl.
I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight.
Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable.
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda).
Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work.
It makes you hungry.
Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday.
Lots of autism and vaccine response.
Stop these massive doses immediately.
Go back to single, spread out shots!
What do we have to lose.
Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism.
We lose nothing to try..
@Toure, when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello.
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling..
@Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan.
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate.
He wants Libya and China off the table.
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.
@MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden.
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart.
In a couple of years, he will thank me.
Be smart, Robert.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi.
CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden?
They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit.
Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes.
I'll be tweeting live.
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight.
Always treated me fairly..
@MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden.
The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden.
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night.
Viewership will be way down.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges.
By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening.
No matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit.
He has kept Obama in it, even with his terrible record.
Lance Armstrong fought for 7 years & then just ran out of energy.
Very sad story--although they caught him red handed.
He definitely cheated!
Doesn't the US have better things to do than to destroy an American hero for the world to see?
When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said "Ok, go get him"?
@MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night.
Yet some polls have him winning the debate.
Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing, not the President.
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
My announcement is tomorrow!
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
Last night was the first time Obama said "we" instead of "I" in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.
I don't have time except to say "Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again"!
@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night.
I only wish Mitt was more aggressive!
Thank you to @DailyTelegraph reviewer @NeilMidgley who stated "'You've Been Trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump..
"..
@BBC should never have played that piece of garbage documentary--& yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course.
No wonder @BBC is in such big trouble & boss was just fired--they are lost.
If you like having the world collapse and being told America is leading from behind--vote Obama.
This is not a media event or about Donald J. Trump--- this is about the United States of America.
This is not a media event or about Donald J. Trump--- this is about the United States of America.
I will be...
Story will be released today at 12 noon EST on Twitter and Facebook.
All predictions re: my 12 o'clock release are totally incorrect.
Stay tuned!
You have all been waiting-- the response has been amazing!
Watch my announcement now, press release to follow at 12:15.
As stated, here is the press release.
The response has been fantastic--- actually overwhelming!
Thank you!
Virtually all Presidents and candidates including John McCain, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush...
My offer to Obama is about transparency.
In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change.
This our last chance to get the full record.
Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive.
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.
As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity.
What does Obama have to lose?
I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth.
A puppet of Obama?
I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.
Why can't he release his records?
Especially when $5M is going to charity....
By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity.
In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public...
Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.
It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.
Just stated by a total pro: "You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking".
How does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform?
She is a dummy--just look at her past.
Excited to announce that @GiulianaRancic & @BravoAndy will be hosting the 2012 Miss Universe Pageant.
Great ratings for Miss Universe.
Miss Universe 2012 Pageant will be airing live on @nbc & @Telemundo december 19th.
Open invite stands for Robert Pattinson.
Still waiting for an explanation about why @GiulianaRancic & @BillRancic did not name their son Donald.
Unbelievable..
@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv  Barbara, unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement--you just don't get it!
@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when I was right about @Rosie.
Besides, I get great ratings on The View..
@BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv--Why did you choose me as one of the 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year last season (and more than once?
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.
Everyone wins.
Take the deal..
@Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria.
He will always do great!
What will be the response on Wednesday?
If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
I hope Derek Jeter’s recovery is going well.
He is a very special player and a great guy.
New York loves him.
For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...
Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30.1st nite of Sweeps.
Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before.
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
Letterman @Late_Show was great last night.
I had a lot of fun.
You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres.....
instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain.....
@SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!
The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity.......
I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold--I predicted Newsweek.
I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100...
Dopey Arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me--boring story after boring story...
but I hear she is in big trouble!
a real loser named Tim O'Brien--and it's never recovered.
Stupid Arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once-great NYTimes Business Section...
What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost.
How much longer will Arianna last--I predict not much.
One of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer & give $1,250,000 to each family of the four...
Wow!
Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest?
The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney.
He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding.
VOTE!
Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election!
Would be a horrible thing to do.
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester.
The Middle East is a mess.
Yet Colin Powell still endorses him.
Wonder why?
Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
By the way, where is @Oprah?
Good question.
Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
Where's the transparency?
Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright.
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day.
Know you can!
Must win Ohio.
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer.
Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev.
Wright if he releases his records.
Sarah Jessica Parker voted “unsexiest woman alive” – I agree.
She said “it’s beneath me to comment on the...
Great!
Barack Obama has everything to gain.
Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity?
If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something!
If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?
Watch Obama's favorability numbers drop even further if he doesn't accept my charitable offer.
I hear they are very unhappy w/ Arianna and @huffingtonpost at @AOL.
I’ll bet she won’t be there for long!
Before Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was “professionally dead”.
I saved her tiny...
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.
Alert...
The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi.
He did nothing...
he is no leader.
A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree..
@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't.
Is this a double standard?
While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.
I guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno.
Bill, you are no Letterman.
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was "probably" born in the US--the word "probably" is a disaster for Obama.
Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute.
He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.
I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country.
Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama.
Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!
So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news.
Let's see what happens later.
We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge.
Free coffee and food.
Direct view of crane from apartment window.
Crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze.
If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office.
All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below, move out!
The water damage to NYC is amazing.
The winds were bad but the water was worse.
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.
Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.
Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.
People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others, I stayed open.
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!
The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks, staff!
So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you!
The election is trending towards @MittRomney.
Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.
These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP.
Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders.
They are American heroes.
I never fall for scams.
How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?
Let’s be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.
Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.
Taylor is terrific!
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition?
Hiding something?
People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out.
Scary.
Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
Fans shouldn't worry.
We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm.
The polls & momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney.
Don't let the hurricane change your thinking!
Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity.
Looking like he won't be doing it.
What is he hiding?
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go.
I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star, Kevin Garnett @Celtics, said to a crowd "Forget Shaq, I want to meet Donald Trump".
Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor--nothing wrong--in fact it was terrific.
A champion!
@oreillyfactor called me a "master marketeer" last night--I am not.
I am a great builder--I build great things & people come.
Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article.
If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star.
How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week?
Another scandal ignored by the liberal media.
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ.
Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater.
In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi..
@Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides.
Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue.
There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records.
A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency.
I don't blame them.
How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show--& his ratings stink.
You'd think @HBO could do a lot better.
Spoiler--@dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice...
Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister, @NewYorkPost, @NewYorkObserver & @NashuaTelegraph endorsements!
President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow.
It is so easy and could do so much good!
President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer!
A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.
The onus is on Obama to first release his records.
Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break.
It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity!
From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast.
Do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane?
Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming.
China is so happy!
You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane-- and Florida doesn't.
To all @MittRomney supporters, make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can GOTV on election day.
Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?
He is ruining American industry.
Obama is a terrible negotiator.
He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
President Obama missed the deadline!
I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
Press release.
Video response to follow.
My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency.
If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused.
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say!
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.
How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?
And he continues to lie to the public!
I will start reviewing various political reporters etc & websites as to their professionalism & fairness—many people asking for this.
Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral.
It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot!
It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama.
With long gas lines & total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama..
@Chrysler disputes my statement--but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election.
We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned!
@RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language--not very professional..
@BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her--sadly, I won't be able to do it..
@TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist--very nice, apology accepted!
I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island & Long Island.
People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country.
Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding.
How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
Unemployment is now 7.9%.
Four years and $6.5T later, that is really bad!
@eagles should sit Michael Vick.
He is a great athlete but less than average quarterback.
A-Rod is now looking for an expensive home in Beverly Hills--why aren't the @Yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation?
I have an idea for A-Rod---buy a home at @TrumpGolfLA overlooking the Pacific--will bring you better luck.
Obama has destroyed the middle class.
In ’09, median household income was $55,198.
Now it is $50,678.
Four more years?
A wonderful place.
Make sure to catch @history’s season finale of “The Men Who Built America” on Sun, November 11th.
Great show.
Obama promised 5.2% unemployment by October 2012.
His promises are worthless!
Castro, Chavez and Ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results.
They are praying Obama wins.
Considering Obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won’t have a mandate.
Another 4 years of legislative stalemate.
I think @TheRevAl should take this challenge.
Axelrod was too scared.
RT: @RonKaufmanIntrn: Kaufstache vs.
Sharpstache.
Pennsylvania is in play @MittRomney.
All undecideds in Philly suburbs should ask themselves - who do you trust most on @Israel?
Undecideds in OH,PA and WI will make the difference.
All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama.
Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years.?
We don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states.
Obama will steal it.
Make sure all your friends and family vote.
Gary Johnson is asking people "to waste" their vote on him.
Make it count - vote for @MittRomney.
Trump Hotels are delivering lots of food to storm victims...
we love doing it!
Make sure you get out and vote...
most important election of our generation...
go Romney!
Remember when you vote, Obamacare is a disaster!
@ralphreed is doing a great job!
Remember, go vote--we need real change this time..
@CNN is looking at Jeff Zucker to lead them out of the forest--Jeff would be a great choice.
It’s extremely cold in NY & NJ—not good for flood victims.
Where is global warming?
We can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming.
China is thrilled with us!
In ’08, America voted for Hope & Change.
Instead, we got incompetency.
Now it is time to put a real job creator in office.
Vote 4 Mitt!
Dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself!
Only 1 mill.
dollars @mcuban?
Offer me real money and I’d consider it.
Your team and networks lose so much money I doubt you have much left!
Don't believe Chrysler (if Obama wins)--see how fast @Jeep production will be moved to China--and I'll be watching!
Like Al Sharpton, @DonnyDeutsch apologized to me for calling me a racist on @todayshow--apology accepted!
Obama is angry, frustrated and desperate..
@mcuban Baseball commissioner and owners were smart when they didn’t want you to buy a team--- but I don’t think you have the money anyway.
Obama just stated "It's always good to ignore Donald Trump".
I state he is right, especially when the truth is against him..
@mcuban, Shark Tank was shoved to Friday evening-- Friday is considered “dead television”.
Besides, you are not the star (& never will be).
After 13 seasons, @ApprenticeNBC easily beat Shark Tank in ratings last year-- better demos as well..
@mcuban Letterman @Late_Show had his best ratings with me--and you bombed.
People don't care about Mark Cuban.
Tomorrow’s election will have historic repercussions for our country.
Make America strong again.
Vote for @MittRomney.
Voting for @GovGaryJohnson is voting for Obama--don't waste your vote!
@ABFAlecBaldwin  They were rising in the 1950's then went back down--they will go up and down through eternity..
@ABFAlecBaldwin  P.S. Your brother @StephenBaldwin7 is doing very well on @ApprenticeNBC--and he stated he "adores you".
China is worried.
The polls are trending for @MittRomney.
They won’t be able to steal from us anymore.
The outer boroughs of Manhattan are still devasted by Sandy.
How would the press cover this if a Republican was President.
Benghazi is bigger than Watergate.
Don’t let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die.
Kick him out of office tomorrow.
Go out and vote--- this will be the most important election of our time!
I was invited to be with Mitt Romney tonight --- win, lose, or draw, I’ll be there!
Why is Obama playing basketball today?
That is why our country is in trouble!
Before you vote, think: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!
Despite the upcoming election, the cover of paper-thin Time Magazine looks like an ad for the movie Lincoln--sad!
Remember: Obama turned down $5M to charity which I said I would increase by 10X to $50M--just to show simple records.
He's hiding lots!
Me voting--- it really is my hair!
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.
In the 1950’s our climate was far more unstable than it has been over the last 5 years.
Make sure to vote today.
Vote for real change.
Change that will deliver jobs and a free & strong America.
Vote for @MittRomney.
Very dangerous pattern developing across country by Obama supporters.
Save Medicare.
Vote for @MittRomney.
He will repeal Obamacare on day one.
More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama.
Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote.
If you have any problems, notify the poll workers.
Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ & Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY & NJ are still decimated by Sandy.
Wrong!
If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately.
Watch Obama refuse to call Benghazi a terrorist attack on 9.
Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public.
He can't.
The federal gov.
has handled Sandy worse than Katrina.
There is no excuse why people don’t have electricity or fuel yet..
@ABFalecbaldwin  Alec--it's not science, it's a con--read the e-mails.
The federal gov.
has handled Sandy worse than Katrina.
There is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet.
Do we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off?
Make America strong, vote for @MittRomney.
I have had the pleasure of getting to know @AnnDRomney & @MittRomney this past year.
They love America.
Let's push them over the top today.
I love show "Law and Order" but the @MRbelzer casting is the worst ever.
No talent--unwatchable!
@MRbelzer is a stone cold loser with no talent--why did they ever put him on "Law and Order"?
Whoever wins today, remember that tomorrow we still have a country struggling.
Our work is not done until America is strong again.
Well, back to the drawing board!
We can't let this happen.
We should march on Washington and stop this travesty.
Our nation is totally divided!
Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice!
The world is laughing at us.
This election is a total sham and a travesty.
We are not a democracy!
Our country is now in serious and unprecedented  trouble...
like never before.
Our nation is a once great nation divided!
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years...
stay strong and never give up!
House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare..
@bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night.
The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings—a disaster!
@bwilliams--wouldn't you love to have my ratings?
The voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error!
Brian--Thanks dummy--I picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone.
Cable News just passed you in the ratings.
Brian, I hope @NBCNightlyNews isn't paying you too much--look at what's happening to nightly news.
Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such.
People will learn the truth!
Brian, if I'm "well past the last exit to relevance" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night?
This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it--reasons why to follow.
Another four years--not good for the country but we'll have to live with it!
Our country is totally split right now but someday it will come together!
We have to make America great again!
It's freezing and snowing in New York--we need global warming!
Amazing, various celebrities were far harsher than me with political statements--- but media doesn't care about...
Pervert alert.
@RepWeiner is back on twitter.
All girls under the age of 18, block him immediately.
Millions without electricity across NY & NJ.
The media has covered for Obama’s massive failure.
Can you imagine if this was another Pres?
Congrats to @KarlRove on blowing $400 million this cycle.
Every race @CrossroadsGPS ran ads in, the Republicans lost.
What a waste of money.
The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.
Welcome to @BarackObama’s second term.
Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night.
The Chinese are happier with the election than we are.
It has been a pleasure to make so many friends and meet so many great people on the trail this past cycle.
We will fight on!
Now that the election is over, watch Chrysler ship @Jeep production to China--my prediction..
@hardball_chris says he’s “glad” we had a hurricane!
A test: tweet me the reason @billmaher was fired from @ABC (other than his bad ratings).
Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his  comments on Sandy & the death & destruction it caused....
I  trounced him in ratings & Letterman beat @jayleno last Thursday.
Brian—are you irrelevant?
It is that time of the year.
The Trump Wollman Skating Rink is open to the public in Central Park.
The greatest ice rink in the country.
Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.
They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now.
I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that A-Rod donated to his campaign.
Everything A-Rod touches turns bad.
I will and I agree!
RT @ZacharyQuinto @realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money.
so why don't you make a difference instead?!
No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.
They love a weak America that they can rip off..
@davidaxelrod I'm sending you a check to help find a cure.
@IvankaTrump says hi.
With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can.
Can get a great deal.
At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes.
This was a winnable race.
GOP needs to do better!
China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.
They have never had it so good.
Will own America soon.
Romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in Florida and Ohio & he would be President.
Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous?
Of the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina.
I'm proud of @NCGOP & glad I delivered keynote at their state convention.
The election was a major setback for economy.
All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments.
Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight.
He took my advice on Kristen Stewart...
I hope!
I received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in Trump Tower during Sandy.
It was my pleasure to help.
I got to know @johnboehner very well—he is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country!
Why do so many people say I hate President Obama—I don’t hate the President at all.
I just disagree with his policies!
@antbaxter—Your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage!
@antbaxter—Heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to make—where did you get that kind of money?
@antbaxter Dummy,thanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in Aberdeen—sales are thru the roof & Aberdeen seeing big benefits..
@antbaxter  I predict somebody is going to sue you!
@antbaxter  Anthony—did you illegally take clips from the Letterman @Late_Show show and @GolfChannel without their approval?
@antbaxter Only the stupid @BBC would air your garbage—no wonder they are in such deep trouble..
@cyndilauper Condolences on the passing of your uncle, and best wishes.
It’s hard to believe that we are rationing gas in NYC.
OPEC is laughing all the way to the bank.
Price gouging at many gas stations, $10 a gallon--welcome to the new world.
She’s baaack!
@Rosie needs me to salvage her dying career.
But it won’t help-- she’s got no talent & no persona.
Too many tv cancellations!
Everybody wants me to talk about Robert Pattinson and not Brian Williams—I guess people just don’t care about Brian!
I just passed a 10 block long gas line going to LGA airport, a terrible situation!
Wow,  I never saw the Petraeus thing coming.
A straight laced guy!
Very sad for him and his family.
I'm a skeptical guy, but I don't believe Petraeus used this to get out of the Benghazi hearings.
I love Twitter....
it's like owning your own newspaper--- without the losses.
Thanks- many are saying I'm the best 140 character writer in the world.
It's easy when it's fun.
Many political pundits are using the term "Art of the Deal"....
they should thank me.
That is my term and book title.
Aberdeen tourism is booming because of my great Scottish golf club.
The people of Scotland love Trump International Golf Links.
Trump International Golf Links was just rated one of the greatest courses in the world.
Virtually all reviews are saying the same thing.
I am a very calm person but love tweeting about both scum and positive subjects.
Whenever I tweet, some call it a tirade..
totally dishonest!
When someone attacks me, I always attack back...
except 100x more.
This has nothing to do with a tirade but rather, a way of life!
We just passed 1.9M followers & gained over 250,000 followers in the last month.
Thank you--let's have fun and do business.
Yesterday was Veterans Day.
I hope our armed service members felt appropriately honored.
This nation loves and respects all of you.
Businesses have already started massive layoffs and reducing employees’ hours due to Obama Care.
Reality is setting in.
How come every time I show anger, disgust or impatience, enemies say I had a tantrum or meltdown—stupid or dishonest people?
No surprise that @BBC is in a major scandal for shoddy journalism.
Any network that air’s @antbaxter’s garbage has zero credibility..
@davidaxelrod  David--Thank you, my great honor for a very worthy cause!
My fragrance--"Success"-- is flying off the shelves @Macys.
The perfect Christmas gift!
they are costly, inefficient, bird killing, community destroying machines.
They are obsolete!
@maddow  Standing in front of wind turbines is sad.
After Friday’s Twilight release, I hope Robert Pattinson will not be seen in public with Kristen--she will cheat on him again!
The sex scandal at the CIA and Pentagon is rapidly unfolding--getting more interesting by the minute!
Don't forget Benghazi.
Our $17T national debt and $1T yearly budget deficits are a national security risk of the highest order.
Paula Broadwell's book on Gen.
Petreus is titled "All In".
Did she know something?
@cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career!
General Petreus and his family are paying a big price!
@cher--I don’t wear a “rug”—it’s mine.
And I promise not to talk about your massive plastic surgeries that didn’t work.
It’s amazing how people can talk about me but I’m not allowed to talk about them.
The upcoming record 13th season of @CelebApprentice is going to be very special.
Our production team's ingenuity is amazing.
Gen.
Petraeus has agreed to testify in the Senate on Benghazi.
I will be watching.
To aspiring entrepreneurs, always remember that if your enemies aren’t talking about you, then you aren’t doing well...
and must work harder!
Had a great time going over renovations for Trump National Doral this past weekend.
It is going to be amazing.
The Blue Monster at Trump National Doral.
Social media has changed the news & communication landscape for good.
Busy day—working on buying a major property—and creating lots of jobs..
@WendyWilliams Thanks for the nice statement, especially about my wife and kids- very much appreciated.
Just signed contract to purchase the Ritz Carlton in Jupiter, Florida--great land, great location, great future!
Our country is being torn apart from the inside--it's getting nasty out there.
Announced 3 years ago that Scottish course would close in winter, like Kingsbarns and others--too cold.
Golf bookings for next season on Scottish course are already double our projections for April opening—great news...
Yesterday the Christmas tree arrived at Rockefeller Plaza.
An iconic event for New York!
With our record debt & trillion $ deficits, our $ is now at an all-time low against the Chinese Yuan.
Time for our gov't to work together.
If the government doesn't start working together, the media is right & we will hit a "fiscal cliff".
We need to avoid this.
President Obama, we need to protect our closest ally, Israel.
The situation in the Middle East is at a tipping point.
Congratulations to @Mets @RADickey43 on becoming the first knuckleball pitcher to ever win the CY Young award!
Fiscal cliff negotiations have officially begun between the President and Congress---Washington must come together and make a deal.
With the run on our dollar about to take place, commodity prices will rise.
Gold, silver, & timber will spike-- also, certain real estate..
@LaurenScruggs, who was badly injured by an airplane, was great on The Today Show!
The Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach is one of the most successful places on earth in raising money for charity--a great feeling!
It makes me feel so good to hit "sleazebags" back -- much better than seeing a psychiatrist (which I never have!
@chelseahandler—stop trying to get your hotelier boyfriend back—a lost cause—he can do much better!
@chelseahandler--stop calling my office for me to do your rather "gross" show--I have less interest in you than Andre.
Everybody tells me not to hit back at the lowlifes that go after me for PR--sorry, but I must.
It's my nature.
Does anyone really believe that President Obama found out about Petraeus immediately after the election?
The Hostess closing did not have to happen--should have been an easy deal to make.
All because of me- people don’t care about you Cher.
"@cher My week on twitter 1k retweets , 29 new listings 15k new followers 2k mentions"..
@redcross CEO’s salary in 2011 was $951,957.
Where is the outrage?
while her charity is getting less than 5 cents per donated dollar.
She should be ashamed!
@unicef Caryl M. Stern CEO is driving around in a Rolls Royce  ...
Do your research before donating this holiday season!
Reports are out there that many CEOs of charities are getting overpaid, while their causes are seeing very little...
Rapper Mac Miller's song, "Donald Trump" has reached close to 72 million hits.
He owes me big!
Petraeus is already negotiating a book deal.
Remember victims of Hurricane Sandy  during Thanksgiving.
Many will not be celebrating the holiday in comfort.
Their lives are in turmoil!
Washington must come together on a deal to avoid a fiscal cliff.
If taxes are raised, they must come with real, hard cuts....
It is time to get out and rebuild our own nation.
We should remember that during this entire Petraeus episode,over 50 of our nation's bravest have died in Afghanistan...
I gave out the Male Athlete of the Year Award last night to my friend @MichaelPhelps—22 Olympic medals—a record that will never be broken....
The @EricTrumpFDN is doing amazing work helping the children...
The upcoming All Star season of @CelebApprentice has @lisarinna returning to compete.
She doesn’t disappoint!
The EU just dropped their self-imposed carbon tax.
I bet they wish they had all that money back!
A must read for any country or community considering wind turbines.
I am going to give @Rosie a pass.
@Rosie is desperate to get back on TV so she can be on yet another show that can be quickly canceled.
I was nice to loser @rosie and she attacked me--it just shows never let up with a bully.
They only fade when you hit them hard!
expect the country to be further downgraded in the future.
The rich are all leaving!
France was just stripped of its AAA bond rating.
With the PMs radical tax rates...
The Holiday Season in New York City is a very special time....
and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties"..
@TrumpSoho has just been awarded the AAA Five Diamond Award.
Congratulations to the team for this great recognition of their amazing work..
@latoyajackson is once again at the top of her game in the upcoming All Star season of @CelebApprentice.
Amazing in the boardroom...
Pres.
Obama’s steady support of @Israel throughout this crisis helped stop the war.
He did a good job.
I hope Washington makes a good deal to avert the fiscal cliff.
Both sides need to work together.
I am having 600 Thanksgiving dinners sent to the Rockaways--prepared by my wonderful Trump Grill/Trump Tower staff.
On December 19th the @MissUniverse pageant will be broadcast live in over 190 countries to one billion viewers.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING to everyone--I love you all, even my many enemies (sometimes!
).
The dying NY Daily News put out a false report about my kids not wanting me to criticize Obama...
totally false!
The dishonest NY Daily News reporter advised my rep in writing, "story is dead" and then put it out anyway.
A total lie and she knew it!
My kids never negatively discussed my criticism of President Obama with me or anyone...
it's not in their nature!
Hope everyone enjoyed their Thanksgiving.
But get ready, our country is in big trouble!
If you treat people right they will treat you right...
ninety percent of the time.
Congratulations to the Rolling Stones on marking their 50th anniversary in London.
If taxes are raised to avoid the fiscal cliff, then they must be accompanied by tangible, hard cuts on spending everywhere.
Wind turbines are totally destroying the areas in which they are located—all for unreliable, bad & expensive energy!
@HuffingtonPost actually gave me a positive story yesterday!
Glad to see my interview with Ronald Kessler @Newsmax_Media.
Hopefully the @GOP can get the message.
When you’re “hot” the lowlifes really shoot at you...
and they try hitting from every angle!
Never let the bastards get you down....
and borrow cheap!
You will thank me someday.
With the economy still on a downward trajectory, the best investment young people can make now is buying property...
Want to know why China is growing?
The Muslim Brotherhood dictator in Egypt is bad news.
He will never be our true ally!
It's called intellectual property rights, something they know nothing about.
China just landed a jet on an aircraft carrier stolen from a U.S. design.
Join @ericbolling to get @vanessariddle to 100k followers.
Beautiful girl with stage 4 cancer.
Are you ready for the All Star @CelebApprentice?
@TraceAdkins is back in the upcoming season...
which is the best yet!
Anthony Hopkins is a truly great actor--I love everything he does!
I just left the Doral in Miami--it is going to be amazing!
I still can’t get over how the Republicans—my friends—spent hundreds of millions of dollars on such terrible & ineffective ads.
Why do the Republicans always negotiate against themselves in public?
Watching them operate these fiscal negotiations is painful.
Be sure to visit the world renowned Trump Tower Atrium to see our holiday decorations....
Get along & make deals for the good of the country!
Susan Rice is a good woman but Pres.
O should not taunt the Republicans by appointing her S of S...
Gabriel Aubry should learn how to fight—he became a punching bag.
Always drama with Halle B!
Visiting LA?
I always enjoy speaking to young aspiring entrepreneurs.
They are hungry, motivated and eager to learn.
Proves America can still be great.
Networks are all wanting me to do shows—like it or not a “ratings machine”!
–but time, I run a really big company!
where he raised 2 million dollars for the wonderful kids.
Eric has a great heart!
My son, @EricTrump, is in Memphis at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital...
Jerry Finkelstein passed away last night--a great New York mover & shaker & a really great guy!
Great that Pres.
O is seeing @MittRomney today—lots of good things can happen.
FM @AlexSalmond of Scotland spent more than $750,000 of taxpayers $ to visit Ryder Cup in Chicago--peanuts compared to his windmill folly.
Scottish government having  huge backlash on wind turbines.
@AlexSalmond is becoming very unpopular.
The Countryside Party just formed in Scotland to fight ugly wind turbines & @AlexSalmond.
Congrats to Jim Crawford & Countryside Party.
The Trump Tower restaurant, Trump Grill, just received the highest sanitary inspection grade possible, “A” – the food is also great!
Steven Spielberg is a great filmmaker.
Go see "Lincoln".
It’s Thursday.
How much did OPEC steal from all of us today?
Crude is about to pass $90/barrel.
The OPEC monopoly must be broken.
They are robbing our country blind..
@BBCNews’ child molestation sex scandal is the latest in continued downward spiral of BBC.
While Derek Jeter is training every day in the off season, reports come out that A-Rod is partying all over the country.
Go Derek.
Back by popular demand, the record 13th season of ‘All Star’ @CelebApprentice features the return of @bretmichaels.
Our fans will be happy.
A clip from guest hosting @extratv yesterday on @nbc discussing Halle, Angus and Gen.
Always enjoy appearing on @extratv.
@MarioLopezExtra & @mariamenounos were terrific yesterday.
Team Trump with the recipients of our donations in the Rockaways.
France is losing its businesses and wealth rapidly and day by day.
In calling my tweets ‘obnoxious,’ @AOL says “I sure know how to keep them wanting more”.
They are welcome.
I just tell it like it is.
I’m surprised that Gabriel Aubry has settled so quickly and easily with Halle—in the long run it was a wise decision.
Now that it’s almost over, I can’t believe that unions & management couldn’t save Twinkies etc--& management just got a  $1.75M  bonus....
The NY Daily Snooze totally lied and never even called my kids!
Thank you to @IvankaTrump for her wonderful acknowledgement this morning on @foxandfriends  The Republicans just didn’t resonate with the people—but they will have better days.
As I said on @foxandfriends this A.M., you have to give Obama credit—he won!
I'll be honored  at the Family Business Dynasties Gala in NYC on December 5th.
It will be a great event for a great cause.
Was with @jacknicklaus yesterday--great golfer, great architect, great guy!
@nbcnightlynews (Brian Williams, anyone?
) says women warriors are "every bit as tough as the guys".
Just think about that statement!
It’s about time for all Americans (Republicans & Democrats) to force our elected officials to start acting fiscally responsible!
I am very proud of @IvankaTrump for her work with @Cookies4kids.
Obama is totally “tweaking” the Republicans because he doesn’t respect them—they’ve got to change their ways.
Karl Rove is now making excuses for his total wasting of $400M—not one win—(the Republicans better get smart next time)...
Obama is laughing at Karl Rove & all the losers who spent hundreds of millions of dollars and didn’t win one race, including the big one!
The Daily Snooze publishes lies about me.
They should be ashamed but it will die very soon..
@StephenBaldwin7 shines in the record 13th season of ‘All Star’ @CelebApprentice.
The Baldwin clan will be proud of Stephen.
Comic @sethmeyers21 bombed at University of Texas at Arlington—crowd was dismal as was his performance—I told you so!
Michael Forbes lives in a pigsty and bad liquor company Glenfiddich gave him Scot of the Year award...
Michael Forbes is a loser who failed to stop what was just named “the golf course of the year” and which has brought ...
The Democrats have zero intention of coming to any deal on the "fiscal cliff".
They will raise taxes and blame it on the Republicans.
The networks are all driving me crazy to do television shows—“a ratings machine”—but because of Apprentice have been loyal  to NBC.
Just completed purchase of magnificent Ritz Carlton in Jupiter, Florida.
Will be renamed Trump National Golf Club & be tremendous success.
Just won the highest rated sanitary award in NY—an A--& the food is great also.
Trump Grill/ 57th & 5th.
Great defense by the @nyjets this weekend—congratulations to @woodyjohnson4—only 6 points allowed!
Fan favorite @LilJon once again shines in the record 13th season of 'All Star' @CelebApprentice.
He is an amazing & wonderful guy!
Congratulations to David Wright on signing a long term extension with the @Mets.
David is an exceptional player and person.
How could Michael Forbes get Scot of the Year when he lost—badly—to me & Andy Murray, a true Scot, who won the U.S. Open & Olympic gold?
@danabrams, editor of @mediaite, explained on radio this morning that I am so widely covered because I draw high interest.
True!
The @Yankees should break A-Rod's contract immediately—he misrepresented.
A-Rod @Yankees had hip surgery & will be out 6 months.
Do you notice all the “druggies” have bad hips.
The stock of my shirt and tie maker just hit an all-time high--great going--great product!
If you are planning to visit the world famous Trump Tower Atrium, be sure to come early.
Glenfiddich is a joke—should have chosen Andy Murray—U.S. Open & Olympic gold winner—as Top Scot instead of a total loser!
Tell ‘Top Scot’ Michael Forbes to clean up his property—it is an embarrassment to Scotland.
We are getting rid of all Glenfiddich garbage alcohol from Trump properties..
@GeorgeTakei is doing really well & soon coming to Broadway.
I am happy to hear that Pres.
Obama is considering giving Anna Wintour @voguemagazine an ambassadorship.
She is a winner & really smart!
The record 13th season of ‘All Star’ @CelebApprentice features the return of the beautiful @BrandenRoderick.
The fans love her!
@danabrams Dan, of course stories on me do well.
Glad you have found a medium you can actual do well on.
TV was not your forte.
Dave Brubeck was great and will be missed!
Speaker @johnboehner seems to have gained strength in house—a good thing!
@johnboehner—if you can’t make a great deal go over the cliff & negotiate new deal along with debt ceiling in February!
—Trump 101.25 days to go until fiscal cliff (bad name)—it is only a fiscal curb!
Debt ceiling is real fiscal cliff...
and that will be interesting!
Republicans have the cards because of the debt ceiling—but it doesn’t seem that way!
Twisted Sister frontman @deesnider shines in the record 13th season of ‘All Star’ @CelebApprentice.
The Iron Man of Rock and Roll is great!
Scots should boycott Glenfiddich garbage for not choosing great Olympic & U.S. Open champ Andy Murray over total loser Michael Forbes.....
on ruining Scotland’s beauty with ugly & costly wind turbines?
Is PM Cameron a dummy?
With monumental cuts in UK spending, how come he continues to spend billions of pounds ...
Karzai of Afghanistan is not sticking with our signed agreement.
They are dropping us like dopes.
Get out now and re-build U.S.!
My support of Anna Wintour for Ambassador got a lot of coverage.
She is smart and will be a strong advocate for the US.
All the contestants have arrived to compete in Trump Miss Universe Pageant in Las Vegas.
Today’s welcoming ceremony will be terrific!
and opened a full month ahead of schedule.
Case is taught in Wharton.
When I renovated Wollman Rink in Central Park, it came in $750,000 under budget..
How can George Osborne reduce UK debt while spending billions to subsidize Scotland’s garbage wind turbines that are destroying the country?
You’re all wrong—check the facts!
UK is massively subsidizing Scotland’s wind turbines & the people don’t want them....
and, in my opinion, should not be doing The Apprentice..
@Lord_Sugar  If you think ugly windmills are good for Scotland you are an even worse businessman than I thought .
to do The Apprentice but I approved you anyway.
Without my show you’d be nothing!
Sugar: @Lord_Sugar—unlike you, I own The Apprentice.
You were never successful enough You have little persona, but The Apprentice concept is great and lucky for you!
Sugar: @Lord_Sugar--Keep working hard so I make plenty of $ with your show  and many others.
Drop to your knees, Sugar, and say thank you, Mr. Trump.
Dopey @Lord_Sugar—Look in the mirror and thank the real Lord that Donald Trump exists.
You are nothing!
Alex Rodriguez has played under 140 games in each of the last five seasons.
He will miss half of next season.
Really bad deal for @yankees.
We are way over the fiscal cliff.
And with Obama Care being fully implemented in less than 14 months, it may be too late....
instead of biting the hand that feeds you!
Don’t bother, just keep making me money!
Sugar @Lord_Sugar—you should say thank you, Donald, like a good little boy......
Sugar @Lord_Sugar  Unlike yours, my financials are phenomenal.
People don't know your real numbers & would not be impressed.
Sugar @Lord_Sugar  Why don't you tell the public what you're really worth--they would be very disappointed.
Dopey Sugar @Lord_Sugar--I'm worth more than $8 billion, acknowledged, almost no debt ...
Dopey Sugar.
@Lord_Sugar  ...
Your net worth doesn't even qualify you to host the Apprentice.
Keep making me money...
@Lord_Sugar....
but you wouldn’t notice because you have no vision and you are a total loser.
Dopey Sugar @Lord_Sugar  The wind turbines are ruining the beauty & majesty of Scotland......
@Lord_Sugar  You need the income from the show to keep going--hope it doesn't hurt.
Dopey @Lord_Sugar  People are calling in saying you are being beaten badly w/ the tweets...
Dopey  @Lord_Sugar  I'm worth $8 billion and you're worth peanuts...
without my show nobody would even know who you are.
To Tom Brady @patriots and Gisele--Best wishes on the birth of your daughter.
Tom is a great player and great friend.
I just retained Sir Nick Faldo to be the architect of the Red Course at Doral--he will do a tremendous job!
Back by popular demand, TV personality @TheRealMarilu returns in the record 13th season of 'All Star' @CelebApprentice.
Marilu does great!
Today's job report is not a good sign & we could be facing another recession.
No real job growth.
We need over 300K new jobs a month.
This year's Trump Miss Universe Pageant is comprised of truly beautiful women.
Will be simulcast live December 19th on @nbc and @Univision.
Many people still out of power in Staten Island.
Absolutely ridiculous.
Why can't they get service?
This is such a special time to be in New York City.
No better city in the world to celebrate Christmas!
People ask me what I do in my free time.
The answer--I don't have any.
Sorry for such silence—spent weekend at closing of Ritz Carlton in Jupiter, Florida—just bought it, will be great!
Dopey Sugar @Lord_Sugar  I never go silent.
I was buying a major property in Florida--a property worth more than you are!
Dopey Sugar @Lord_Sugar  I hear your ratings last week were at an all time low--you better get them up or you'll be fired.
Dopey Sugar @Lord_Sugar  Bad ratings--come on, keep making me money--remember, I own your show.
Dopey Sugar—@Lord_Sugar  Isn’t it sad that my golf course in Scotland just got “best new course in the world”—it’s worth more than you are!
Dopey Sugar @Lord_Sugar You should thank me for having created the platform on which you became known--The Apprentice..
@Lord_Sugar  If you didn’t say the iPod would be gone in a year, you might have been really rich instead of the peanut money you have.
Dopey Sugar @Lord_Sugar—you are the worst kind of loser—a total fool.
I just bought stock in Tiffany & Company and McDonald's.
Two ends of the spectrum but I like both companies.
China is about to acquire a unit of AIG, which we bailed out, for $5.
The Chinese are smart.
Great knockout on Saturday by Juan Manuel Marquez on Manny Pacquiao.
A great fight!
Great win by the @nyjets yesterday.
If they run the table, they will make the playoffs.
The Ground Zero Mosque should not go up where planned.
It is wrong.
My offer still stands to buy the property.
Good deal for everyone.
I still don't get how @KarlRove spent $400 million & lost all.
If the Republicans ever want to win a presidential election in the next 30 years they must get rid of @KarlRove.
He is useless.
Good luck to Bob Kraft, Tom Brady, and Coach Bill Belichick tonight.
Some dope tweeted my message to my friend Bill Belichick incorrectly--they called him Bob.
Sorry Bill!
The UK is seriously thinking about halting wind turbine subsidies.
Good news, killing country..
China is buying so many of our companies-- it’s really getting bad....
If you plan for the worst—if you can live with the worst—the good will always take care of itself.
He’s back and causing more trouble than ever before!
@THEGaryBusey returns in the record 13th season of ‘All Star’ @CelebApprentice.
Trump Miss Universe, simulcast on @nbc and @Telemundo on December 19th, will once again deliver an entertaining and ‘beautiful’ show!
It’s Tuesday.
How many more customers has Glenfiddich lost today?
The Republicans must use the debt ceiling as leverage to make a great deal!
Re Life:  Life is very fragile and success doesn’t change that.
If anything, success makes it more fragile.
…you can enhance location through promotion and work.
Re Real Estate: You don’t necessarily need the best location.
For those of you in trouble—(in these troubled times)—never, ever give up!
I let @pennjillette come back on the record 13th season of ‘All Star’ @CelebApprentice after he relentlessly begged me to--good t.

Can you believe the Republicans are studying the Democrats on how to win an election?
No money wasted like bad ads—the Republicans spent more & got nothing for it.
The amazing Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles.
You get what you vote for.
I have helped many friends and colleagues in their business ventures.
They always thank me after they succeed.
The gorgeous contestants of Trump Miss Universe are so excited to be simulcast on both @nbc and @Telemundo.
Will be a beautiful show!
Egypt is a total mess.
We should have backed Mubarak instead of dropping him like a dog.
We can’t even stop the Norks from blasting a missile.
China is laughing at us.
It is really sad.
A friend is one who has the same enemies as you have.
Watching Pyongyang terrorize Asia today is just amazing!
Thousands of fans have been sending letters to Trump Tower in anticipation of @CelebApprentice.
Really good show.
Windmills are destroying every country they touch--- and the energy is unreliable and terrible.
A horrible day for Newtown, CT and our country yesterday.
My condolences to all of the families so tragically affected.
In moments like this,we are all just Americans.
I join with the President, religious and civic leaders and encourage all to pray today.
I find the photos of these children killed in Newtown in the New York Post heartbreaking.
Video game violence & glorification must be stopped—it is creating monsters!
In light of Newtown, our country has to pull together.
The tragedy in Newtown really makes you understand how life is so fragile.
Must appreciate every minute!
Many people advised me not to buy the Miss Universe pageant.
They were all wrong.
The deal worked out to be a great one!
In Las Vegas for the Miss Universe Pageant—airing tonight on @nbc at 8 o’clock.
They asked me to dress as Santa Claus to open Miss Universe tonight—I’m thinking about it!
Miss Universe contestants are amazing—the most beautiful ever!
@MissUSA Olivia Culpo has been a star, a young Audrey Hepburn.
I hope Newtown CT can now start to heal—but it won’t be easy!
Worst ever issue of @VanityFair magazine—bad food Graydon Carter should be fired!
@VanityFair looks like a dying magazine!
Really really boring, really really thin!
Pageant people are really talking about Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico, USA, India, Australia.
This is a buyers’ market.
Buy now.
You will thank me in 3 years.
Tweet me tonight who your favorite is during the live telecast of the Miss Universe Pageant.
Sheena Monnin acted terribly...
she got what she deserved!
If Sheena Monnin apologized for her mistake, as she should have, I would have treated her very nicely.
Dummy Graydon Carter doesn't like me too much...
great news.
He is a real loser!
So if you want to aim high, you have to have the guts to handle the inevitable bumps in the road"....
now it’s the “greatest pageant on earth”-- broadcast in 190 countries to 1 billion people—“hot!
You get what you vote for.
Our new @MissUniverse Olivia Culpo is not only beautiful but intelligent and accomplished.
She is a wonderful role model..
@Rosie--If America's Got Talent uses you, the show will fail like all your others!
Dopey @Rosie--I never went bankrupt--ABC already apologized to me for your stupid statement in the past--they didn't want a lawsuit.
Washington is in total gridlock—no trust, no leadership—very interesting!
How is @VanityFair editor Graydon Carter allowed to run bad food restaurant Beatrice Inn?
Fire Graydon!
From my family to yours...
I want to wish you all a very merry Christmas!
Watching these politicians trying to get a deal done is truly painful --- Republicans are in a much stronger position than they think.
Congratulations to @FLGovScott --- the state is really making progress --- and fast!
Back by popular demand, the fabulous @LilJon returns to the record setting 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.
The fans love him!
I hate hearing after all of the hard work that @MittRomney never wanted to become President.
I told the Republicans the debt ceiling talks should come before election--& we would have a Republican president—they wouldn’t listen..
It’s Thursday.
How much time did Washington waste today trying to find a solution on the so-called fiscal cliff?
Republicans remember—debt ceiling, debt ceiling, debt ceiling—be smart and you will win!
Sorry to hear of yesterday’s passing of General Norman Schwarzkopf.
He was a terrific general and leader--we could use more like him.
Spolier alert…the record setting 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice also features the return of previous winners in the boardroom.
My @gretawire interview re: how the debt ceiling is key point, the fiscal curb & why we must & can make a great deal.
The Republicans once again hold all the cards with the debt ceiling.
They can get everything they want.
Focus!
Any deal completed before the fiscal curb must have tangible cuts on expenditures, in baseline spending, so we can get our credit back.
Obama wants taxes to go up so he can take credit for lowering them next year.
Once again Obama is going to lose on another prospective nomination.
Chuck Hagel will not be named Sec.
of Defense--& probably shouldn't be.
I always enjoy watching young entrepreneurs enter the business world.
I can tell who reads my books and who doesn’t.
Raising the capital gains tax in this fragile economic time is the dumbest thing Washington could do.
So they will probably do it.
Visiting New York City?
Obama and the Democrats are laughing at the deal they just made...
the Republicans got nothing!
I am a Republican...
but the Republicans may be the worst negotiators in history!
What is Mitch McConnell thinking?
make the big deal!
Maybe Boehner will stop this one sided deal in the House...
I hope so!
This is a terrible deal for the country and an embarrassment for Republicans!
Does any Republican have the ability to negotiate?
The party of the year in Palm Beach was the New Year's Eve celebration at the Mar-a-Lago Club--it was amazing.
Congratulations to @RobinRoberts on celebrating 100 days in her bone marrow transplant recovery.
Robin is a special person.
The Republicans must face reality & create a strong & positive immigration policy--if not they will continue to lose elections..
@GOP’s election loss and failed negotiations will serve as a case study in how third parties come about.
Obama's deal raises taxes on 77% of national households.
With Obama Care taxes kicking in now, everyone will be paying for his 2nd term....
Remember--I told you so.
Make sure you realize that this ‘deal’ is only a stop gap measure.
Obama will be looking to raise even more taxes in the coming negotiation..
This ‘deal’ @RNC voted for has $41 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts.
It is pathetic.
Obama is laughing at them.
New York City hosted over 52 million visitors in 2012..
@RGIII & @DangeRussWilson & Luck are very special players--will be great playoff games.
I can't believe Republican leadership allowed such a stupid deal to be made.
They are rapidly giving up all of their cards.
The boardroom has never been as intense as in the upcoming13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.
Premieres March 3rd on @NBC!
The Republicans look so weak and foolish—what the hell are they doing?
So Obama and Congress can waste billions in Iraq & Afghanistan building roads & schools but can’t get money to the NJ & NY Sandy victims?
Great to see Sec.
Clinton leaving the hospital yesterday with @ChelseaClinton and Pres.
Clinton.
Glad she is recuperating.
Republicans had all the cards but not the guts to make a great deal!
The Trump Organization is going revolutionize Rio de Janeiro’s downtown port area with Trump Towers.
Construction begins soon!
I’ll bet Obama now uses the amendment for the debt ceiling.
Just shows that you can have all the cards and lose if you don’t know what you’re doing.
Make sure you take some time to enjoy the weekend.
Important for your mind and will help you be productive next week.
To all young entrepreneurs entering the business world - stay positive, focused and remember everything has its ups and downs.
The 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice is unique.
We really pushed the envelope here.
Our great and loyal fans will love it..
@ArsenioOFFICIAL  Thx for the good wishes--you are going to have a really big year!
I hope the Republicans are happy.
Just as I predicted, that stupid deal they voted for only whetted Obama’s appetite for more taxes.
Nominating Chuck Hagel for SOD is the wrong move for Obama.
He doesn’t need the fight.
Too much political capital will be wasted.
Glad to hear my @foxandfriends’ Monday interview continues to get big ratings.
Wow—Golf Magazine just named Trump Scotland “best new course”.
Golf Odyssey just named Trump Scotland “Golf course of the year”.
Congratulations to @AlabamaFTBL on winning the BCS championship last night!
Why would Obama ever nominate someone for Sec.
of Defense who opposes sanctions against Iran when Obama claims to support them?
The Iranians are sure happy with Obama’s nomination of Hagel.
Miss Alabama, Katherine Webb, has been a truly great representative of the Ms. USA Organization ..
We are proud of her!
What a great couple...
Katherine Webb and AJ McCarron.
They are both winners!
We are going to ask Katherine Webb to be a judge at the Miss USA Pageant coming up in Las Vegas.
The fans are going to love the tasks in the upcoming 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.
The biggest yet!
@FranksFight  Keep fighting, Frank!
Never give up!
@billmaher was so nervous talking about me on the @jayleno show—I’ve never seen him like that!
Lawyers have sent @billmaher demand notice and necessary documentation.
I have accepted @billmaher’s $5 million offer paid to me for charity (made on the @jayleno show)....
American Cancer Society, and the Dana Farber Cancer Center.
The charities I have designated for @billmaher's donations are: Police Athletic League-New York, March of Dimes, Hurricane Sandy victims....
I hope @billmaher pays quickly so that this money can immediately be given to the charities.
Apparently @MartinBashir said something about me on his show yesterday.
I was surprised to find out he is on TV.
Who knew?!
It’s amazing that people can say such bad things about me but if I say bad things about them, it becomes a national incident.
This is how it starts.
He's back!
@THEGaryBusey returns to cause even more trouble in the13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.
I hope @billmaher comes through with his $5 million offer, which I fully accepted, or I will be forced to sue him.
All goes to charity!
I will be doing @hannityshow tonight on Fox at 9 o’clock.
Will be interesting and tough!
@NBA hall of famer @dennisrodman brings his A game in the 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.
This time, Dennis is a star!
New rule for @billmaher: check the law before you make a public absolute offer.
Scary.
Again, don’t forget to watch @hannityshow tonight on Fox at 9 o’clock EST.
The Baldwin family is well represented in the 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice with @StephenBaldwin.
Stephen does great.
The Republicans are always worried about the press--they should just do what is right.
Let’s get out of Afghanistan.
Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there.
Nonsense!
Rebuild the USA.
I can’t wait to donate @billmaher’s $5 million to charity.
Just waiting on @billmaher to send me the money.
Wow, I have just exceeded 2 million followers--and in such a short time!
Congratulations to Tom Brady @Patriots -- he is a great quarterback and a great champion!
Congratulations to Bob Kraft and Coach Bill Belichick for having built an amazing team.
Peyton Manning should have passed on 3rd down!
I can’t believe @Denver_Broncos allowed final touchdown—dumbest defensive play I have ever seen in football....
and will be very embarrassed unless they get smart fast.
The Republicans have been played into a trap by the President--they forgot the 14th amendment.....
I am a handwriting analyst.
Jack Lew’s handwriting shows, while strange, that he is very secretive—not necessarily a bad thing.
Dopey @billmaher is in for a lot of trouble—I hope he has $5 million (for charity).
By the way, folks, @billmaher is not a smart guy (just look at his past)—he just pretends he is!
Is @billmaher the dumbest man on television?
—I think so.
Lance Armstrong is now going to admit guilt—can that be possible after many years of denying?
Just go away Lance.
According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics.
Can you imagine if Obama had to give today's press conference before the election?
He would have lost.
@GOP really blew it.
Just as I predicted, today Obama called for even more tax increases.
The Republicans played right into his hands and blew their cards.
Back by popular demand, @latoyajackson returns to the 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.
She is fierce in the Board Room!
@nbc did a great job last night with the @GoldenGlobes!
Sadly, I’m probably helping @billmaher’s lowly rated show—but charity will benefit by $5 million so it’s worth it.
Still waiting for a response from @billmaher.
Does he even have $5 million?
Everyone is starting to feel the new tax hikes.
You get what you vote for!
I agree with Pres.
Obama on Afghanistan.
We should have a speedy withdrawal.
Why should we keep wasting our money -- rebuild the U.S.!
It is snowing in Jerusalem and across Lebanon.
Global warming!
debut her first 2013 “Melania® Timepieces & Fashion Jewelry” collection!
Please tune in January 15th at 6:00AM EST, and 6:00PM EST, to the QVC network to watch my wife @MELANIATRUMP...
If someone says “I’ll bet you ten dollars” and loses the bet, it’s pay up time.
Can you believe that the Afghan war is our “longest war” ever—bring our troops home, rebuild the U.S., make America great again.
Where’s the press?
Never bet against Bob Kraft, Bill Belichick or Tom Brady!
From Bloomberg: “Chrysler’s Jeep expects China production agreement soon”.
I told you so.
Lance Armstrong is having a breakdown.
What is he doing—his life is now officially over!
Lance Armstrong’s liability & lawsuits against him have just increased tenfold—his lawyers will be very happy—lots of fees!
Unlike U.S., China taxes things made in the U.S. and sold in China.
China demands plants, we don’t.
Stupid!
We were led to believe that Jeep would manufacture in U.S. and sell to China—like China does to us..
@Playboy Playmate of the Year @BrandenRoderick returns to the 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice--she is smart & beautiful....
Is a third party coming?
I hope not....
to OPEC countries that hate our guts.
It’s stupid policy”.
Does anyone really believe that Chuck Hagel is sorry for any of his past comments or supports Israel?
Re Lance Armstrong—not only was it a big lie but a big lie that lasted too long!
Our country, under President Obama, is on life support!
Great leaders must bring people together.
Glad to hear Derek Jeter just removed his boot and is practicing on the field for @yankees.
Derek is a true champion.
China watched Obama’s press conference yesterday salivating.
We will be borrowing trillions more from them.
Does anyone remember this @BillMaher clip when he got fired from ABC- in fact, fired like a dog!
If everybody sued the Journal News for revealing their info (guns)- paper would go out of business.
Journal News readership is already down 50 percent over the years.
Lance Armstrong was given very,very bad advice!
Lance Armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to Oprah.
I’ll bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again.
Look, I have always liked Lance Armstrong- I just hated what he did to himself, including recently.
His life will now be hell.
The first ever All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC premieres Sunday March 3rd!
Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of @Deadspin for exposing the Manti Te’o fiasco....
or mentally troubled (or a con).
Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died.
He is either very stupid....
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
IMO--- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy..
@ESPN’s apology(Brent Musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting--- stop being so politically correct!
Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking- he is much more popular now than before.
Dumbass @BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity--- we just presented him with a demand notice..
@BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot, and maybe he will stop making offers he can’t afford..
@BillMaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep--- better than Sominex..
@HBO should fire @BillMaher and bring back @DennisDMZ- someone that is actually funny.
I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah-- he's saying to himself "what was I thinking"?
The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems- sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide..
@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company!
All time hit leader Pete Rose should now be in the Baseball Hall Of Fame.
He has paid his penalty!
Miss Alabama @_KatherineWebb stopped by to say hello today.
You wouldn't believe how tall and beautiful @_KatherineWebb is- 6'5" in heels.
She is also a total winner in...
Lance Armstrong did himself great harm last night.
Lawsuits & failure will follow him!
@Oprah was great-- amazing that she got Lance Armstrong to totally destroy his life.
Why did he ever do that interview?
The interview was great for @Oprah and terrible for Lance Armstrong!
Te’o’s imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all time—or he’s very stupid.
I still say Te'o did this in order to get sympathy for the Heisman vote—thankfully he did not win.
Alabama people are saying their team has real football & real girlfriends—not good for Notre Dame—but they’ll be back!
@Deadspin guys are total losers—they had their story stolen right from under their bad complexions—other media capitalized!
Dummies @Deadspin had their big payday taken from them by others in the media..
@Deadspin will never make it—they don’t understand graciousness or money—and best guy is leaving?
@Deadspin’s disgusting response will teach me & others not to be nice anymore—a sad lesson.
Champion @bretmichaels triumphantly returns to 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice.
Spoiler – Bret is back to his winning ways..
@_KatherineWebb with some of my memorabilia.
New York should Frack.
Thousands of jobs and millions in revenue.
NY would be a truly rich state.
Most people think small, because most people are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning.
Republicans and Democrats must come together now to make America great again!
Wow...
NYT reports @celebrityapprentice was the number 1 show in branding on television for all of 2012.
I wish President @BarackObama the best of luck in his second term Whether you are a Republican or Democrat we should hope that Pres.
@BarackObama  does a great job for the country.
My @foxandfriends interview discussing Pres.
Obama’s second term is going to very tough for the Republicans.
The Republicans must pick their battles wisely and play smart.
Get ready for the fireworks between @OMAROSA & @latoyajackson in 13th season of All Star @CelebApprentice!
Neither one will back down.
Hypocrites!
Glad to hear @InsideEdition has hired @_KatherineWebb to cover @SuperBowl.
She will be absolutely terrific!
Miss USA pageant is proud.
The President’s speech was very combative toward Republicans—they have obviously not earned his respect!
Republicans, don’t extend the debt ceiling—make the great deal now!
If the Republicans need a chief negotiator I am always available--or can recommend some really good ones!
Obama’s speech indicates he wants to change this country as we know it--wow, he really feels emboldened.
Part of Obama’s new-found confidence is that the Republicans aren’t using their power of ideas properly or effectively.
You must promise that you will never cheat off Manti Te’o’s test papers.
Here I am with @RodStewart at Mar-a-Lago..
@KeithUrban is excellent on American Idol—great touch, solid guy!
@BarbaraJWalters   Barbara—get better fast & stay healthy forever.
The worst negotiators in history (otherwise known as Republicans) have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months.
Pathetic!
Republicans are always worried about their general approval.
With proposing to 'ignore the debt ceiling' they are ignoring their base.
One positive from last week for Lance was that everyone was focused on Manti Te'o!
Why did Lance do that interview?
The Tea Party delivered the House for @GOP so they could be fiscally responsible.
Instead they have been irresponsible!
Has Pres.
Obama or the White House told the public what happened in Algeria yet?
Where’s the media?
Scary.
Happy 8th Anniversary to @MELANIATRUMP.
I cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling—I am a Republican & I am embarrassed!
When the New York Times sold their beautiful, long-time building for peanuts & the buyer flipped it for a massive profit—they lost me!
in order to occupy space in a truly ugly office building in a much worse location!
The New York Times should never have moved out of their magnificent, original home...
Back by popular demand, @TraceAdkins delivers in the upcoming @CelebApprentice All-Stars season.
Yes, he sings.
Congratulations to @netanyahu on his electoral victory.
He will now be the longest serving @IsraeliPM.
A great leader.
Stamps are going up once again.
Now the US postal service will lose even more money.
Please tell me what is going on with the Republicans?
I still can’t believe we left Iraq without the oil.
There is no world problem which cannot be solved if people of good will & intelligence want it to be.
Do you notice the silence lately on wind turbine monstrosities?
The people of Scotland & many other countries are fighting back..
@billmaher has not yet sent me the $5M he owes which I am giving to various charities.
Come on Bill—you made a deal.
I just saw my new tie & shirt collection—it’s fantastic—unbelievable look.
Go to Macy’s now to buy!
@CelebApprentice having “top brand impact 2012”  ahead of Idol, Survivor, X Factor & all others has caused quite a stir- no surprise!
Top brand impact is what television is all about from the commercial standpoint—a big deal for @CelebApprentice.
Almost every television network wants me badly—but I stay loyal to @NBC.
Today’s assignment: read Chapter 7 ‘Trump Tower: The Tiffany Location’ of The Art of the Deal.
Focus on how I marketed the property.
By continuing to give massive subsidies to Scotland’s ugly wind turbines, @David_Cameron is playing right into @AlexSalmond’s hands..
@gretawire  Greta—you’re wrong, Kirsten Powers is a dummy—wasn’t she Anthony Weiner’s girlfriend?
Today’s assignment: read chapter three of Think Big “Basic Instincts”.
Focus on my acquisition of 40 Wall Street..
@THEGaryBusey returns to @CelebApprentice All-Stars this season.
His streak of chaos and havoc continues!
Terrible for the economy and a job killer.
China is laughing at us!
Watch Obama push major global warming legislation early in his second term...
The real estate market is slowly improving.
Still a great time to buy.
You will thank me in 5 years.
The Republicans better be careful.
Obama is out to destroy them!
It all comes down to one simple question: How much money can you stand to lose?
That’s how much risk you should assume.
Wow, the ALIS just nominated my purchase of Doral in Miami as Transaction of the Year—thanks!
Bought @JohnDeere stock a year ago for old fashioned reason—I love their product and service.
One of the country’s dumbest newspapers—The Palm Beach Post--should be put to sleep.
It’s dying..
@PhilMickels0n_  is right—California taxes are far too high.
It’s ridiculous.
Got to know Senator @JohnKerry in Aspen, Colorado years ago—a very solid and stand-up guy.
Wind turbine syndrome is affecting tremendous numbers of people in their wake—stop ugly turbines.
The freezing cold weather across the country is brutal.
Must be all that global warming..
@lisarinna is at the top of her game in the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice All-Stars.
Our fans love her.
President Obama's inaugural had record low ratings.
What does that portend?
Lots of people are asking whether or not I should have run for President—stay tuned for the answer.
Maybe I’m old fashioned but I don’t like seeing women in combat.
Spain's government is closing down wind turbines--- the maintenance is higher than the income.
Gov.
@BobbyJindal referred to the Republicans as “the stupid party”.
Now he has given Dems a phrase to use.
Is Gov.
@BobbyJindal the stupid one for using the phrase “the stupid party” when referring to the Republicans?
I wonder how @JoeBiden feels after last night’s love fest between Obama and Hilary on @60Minutes.
Can’t be too happy.
Here I am with Whitney Houston at a party at Mar-a-Lago.
A-Rod should do the Yankees a favor and never play again..
@TigerWoods is playing like his old self in the Farmers Insurance Open.
He will have a great year.
Still waiting to hear from @billmaher.
Every day he dodges me is one less day that $5M is being used for charity.
Two years ago I told everybody to start looking & buying houses—I hope you listened!
(but there is still time).
The new reality.
TV’s darling @TheRealMarilu is back in this year’s “All-Star” @CelebApprentice.
Marilu is a fierce competitor.
Randy Moss said he was the greatest receiver of all time—no way—it was @JerryRice!
Randy Moss should not be bragging about himself—I’m the only one who is allowed to do that!
The Republicans will get zero credit for passing immigration reform—and I said zero!
Immigration reform is fine—but don’t rush to give away our country!
Sounds like that’s what’s happening....
People love to hear their names and their stories said out loud”..
@AlexSalmond See attached article.
Champion @bretmichaels is back competing in the upcoming "All-Star" @CelebApprentice.
Premiere is March 3rd on @NBC at 9 P.M. EST.
Another nasty season premieres Sunday, March 3rd at 9/8c on NBC!
@yankees are privately ecstatic over A-Rod's latest doping bust.
Glad to hear @EWErickson has moved over to @FoxNews.
Erick is a sharp political analyst.
Oh the wonders of the Arab Spring.
I don’t know why the @yankees keep paying A-Rod—they have a perfect out.
Pervert alert--serial sexter @repweiner is polling to test the waters for NYC political run.
Obama's speech in Las Vegas yesterday cost the taxpayer $520 per word and over $1....
will happen when you go against the tide; when you take a risk and it works".
Little @MacMiller sent me an expensive plaque for making his song “Donald Trump” such a big hit.
Mac, you still...
Just did an interview with my friend @MarkSimoneNY.
Congratulations to Mark on his new show on @WOR710..
@CNBC Titans: Donald Trump’ is available to live stream on @netflix and @hulu.
Watch!
Big news—WOW—U.S. economy shrinks!
@IvankaTrump, @EricTrump & @DonaldJTrumpJr take no prisoners in  boardroom of ‘All Star’ @CelebApprentice.
Where do they get it from?
Everyone is asking if and when I will endorse a candidate in the NYC mayoral race.
Yes, I will give my @SuperBowl pick tomorrow.
Watch @_KatherineWebb cover it on @InsideEdition.
The real estate market in Vietnam is booming.
Growth is everywhere in the world, except for the US.
Little @MacMiller, you illegally used my name for your song “Donald Trump” which now has over 75 million hits.
Little @MacMiller, I want the money not the plaque you gave me!
Little @MacMiller, I’m now going to teach you a big boy lesson about lawsuits and finance.
You ungrateful dog!
Little @MacMiller—I have more hair than you do and there’s a slight age difference.
Chuck Hagel showed gross incompetence before yesterdays Senate panel...
our new Secretary of Defense.
Hagel's performance yesterday was the worst I have ever seen before a committee of any kind!
The upcoming All-Star @CelebApprentice puts the celebrities under the hardest tasks we have ever given.
Bad.
@gallupnews survey shows 30% of businesses not hiring-- they are worried they won’t be around in a year.
As promised, my @SuperBowl pick is the San Francisco @49ers.
Instinct has a lot to do with timing.
You have to be patient & wait for your instincts to tell you the best time to make your move.
Ask yourself, "is this a blip or is it a catastrophe"?
and your equilibrium will be kept in check if hard times hit.
Remain open to new ideas.
That's where innovation comes from.
The lights went out in New Orleans...
the Country's lights went out also.
We are not the same place!
The Country is being run just like the stadium.
I picked seven Super Bowl winners in a row & would have been right last night had the refs thrown the flag..
@BillMaher didn’t come through with his promised $5 million for charity so today I will sue him.
I don’t know whether I will win or lose the @billmaher lawsuit but had an obligation to sue for charity.
I am very proud of my friend @OMAROSA.
If Karl Rove & @GOP Establishment continue to attack the Tea Party, who delivered in 2010, then there will be a 3rd Party in 2016..
@marklevinshow has been saying very nice things about me on his show recently.
He has a fantastic radio show that I always enjoy!
Victoria's Secret reps were nasty to @KateUpton and now she is doing great.
I am a cautious optimist.
Call it positive thinking with a lot of reality checks.
$4 gasoline – wow—OPEC is very happy!
Gas prices are going up big league—I told you so—payback to OPEC!
Wise words from my father:  “Know everything you can about what you’re doing”.
Wise words from my mother:  “Trust in God and be true to yourself”.
To entrepreneurs: Watching you could be the motivation for your employees, so make it an example that will best serve your success.
Then ask: What am I pretending not to see?
These two simple questions can pave the way for some very clear answers.
Ask: Is there anyone else who can do this better than I can?
That’s just another way of saying know yourself & know your competition.
The big and highly respected Cooley LLP is handling the @billmaher case for me.
A top firm like Cooley will only submit a case they believe in and can win..
@BrandenRoderick returns in All-Star @ApprenticeNBC  2001 Playmate of the Year is a determined competitor.
She is terrific!
Trump @DoralResort is hosting the WGC @cadillacchamp from March 6th – 10th.
Join me--I will be there all four days.
Glad to hear @BrentBozell, @marklevinshow, @EWErickson & @TPPatriots are standing up to @KarlRove’s attack on the Tea Party.
With the record high February gas prices hurting the economy, even more reason to start fracking.
Will create jobs & lower prices.
Thanks @SherriEShepherd 4 your nice comments today on The View.
U were terrific!
Had a great time on the @HowardStern show this morning—he will and should never change!
Again, immigration reform is fine—but don’t rush to give away our country.
That’s what’s happening!
Re: immigration.
Do the Republicans not realize that Dems will get 100% of 11 million votes no matter what they do?
Immigration reform really changes the voting scales for the Republicans—for the worse!
The best deals are good for everyone, which creates a win-win situation.
Negotiation is persuasion more than power.
Look at the solution, not the problem.
Learn to focus on what will give results.
Keep your momentum.
Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere..
@NBA Hall of Famer @dennisrodman rebounds for a tremendous performance in his return to this year's All-Star @ApprenticeNBC!
Great guy!
Wow- no longer Saturday delivery from U.S. Postal Service- no money- our poor, poor Country!
Congratulations to @gretawire on the 11 year anniversary of @FoxNews 'On the Record.
' Always enjoy being interviewed by Greta.
She's great.
Happy 102nd birthday to President Ronald Reagan.
Every day that passes, Reagan's presidency looks better and better.
Oh the wonders of the Arab Spring..
@sternshow My interview with Howard Stern this morning!
Be tough, be smart, be personable, but don't take things personally.
That's good business.
Terrible CBO forecast for 2013--1.4% GDP growth and 7.
People like doing deals with me because they know it will be profitable, that I work quickly, and that they will be treated fairly.
Obama can kill Americans at will with drones but waterboarding is not allowed—only in America!
Democrats try so hard to mock & belittle Republicans—& the Republicans just don’t fight back—no energy!
Keep the big picture in mind.
There are always opportunites & possibilities & thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
Knowledge requires patience; action requires courage.
Put patience and courage together and you’ll be a winner.
Why are people giving money to Karl Rove when he just wasted $400M without any victories?
Use your head.
Karl Rove is a total loser.
Money given to him might as well be thrown down the drain.
Karl Rove’s strategy and commercials were the worst I have ever seen.
Negotiation is persuasion more than power.
Be reasonable and flexible, and never let anyone know exactly where you’re coming from.
Back by popular demand, this year’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC sees the return of @claudiajordan!
Our fans love her.
Develop your gut instincts and act on them.
You will have your biggest successes when you go with your gut--but be very smart & careful.
China keeps manipulating its currency at our financial expense.
Why do our leaders continually let China run all over us?
Can you imagine if Bush’s administration drafted a memo legalizing the killing of Americans?!
Democrats are such hypocrites.
The dollar always talks in the end--although our pols are killing the dollar!
Is @karlrove incompetent?
See the Ashley Judd ad by @karlrove and you will definitely vote for her and love Obama..
@karlrove’s ad is the best thing that ever happened to Ashley Judd—simply increases her profile.
Being an entrepreneur is not a group effort.
You have to trust yourself and your instincts.
No person who is enthusiastic about his work has anything to fear from life.
Dummy @BillMaher forgot to say that he made an absolute offer which I accepted.
Hopefully, charity gets $5M dollars.
How does @HBO employ @BillMaher with a pathetic show that he does---- what kind of "a special" is that?
Complete garbage!
@BillMaher's so called show on HBO must be the cheapest "special" produced in the history of television--- it sucks!
Good luck @RoccoMediate and nice hat!
Congratulations to my friend @RoccoMediate on winning the big golf tournament today!
I don’t like bullies.
I am not going to stand around and watch @KarlRove target the Tea Party.
Karl Rove gave us Barack Obama.
Loser.
Why does @KarlRove lie about his Reagan credentials?
@KarlRove is far more to blame for Obama's victory than the Tea Party.
Had a great time hosting the Palm Beach County Republican at Mar-a-Lago.
@IngrahamAngle gave a strong speech.
She’s great!
A great person inspires others to see for themselves.
A mediocre person tells.
A good person explains.
A superior person demonstrates.......
but @billmaher is allowed to say that about me.
Can you imagine if @billmaher said about Obama what he said about me (orangutan etc)—the press would run him out of the country...
What do you think of my suing @billmaher for $5M for charity?
He made an offer, I accepted.
Preview of Obama’s SOTU: More taxes, bigger government, shrink the private sector, end the Republicans & bankrupt the country.
Enjoy!
Sad.
Going to Charlotte, NC to speak before more than 20,000 people on Saturday morning—total sellout crowd—will be great!
While in Charlotte this weekend will visit my Trump National Golf Club on Lake Norman—a magnificent place & doing really well!
@MelaniaTrump looks amazing in 2000 @SInow!
It’s okay but why do the haters (& losers) want to follow me on twitter??
Get a life!
Sorry, but @piersmorgan is a good & smart man who is doing really well.
That’s why he won @ApprenticeNBC.
My Doral Country Club purchase was made just before Miami real estate market went through the roof—good timing!
The new course at Trump International Scotland will be a par-72 layout, with five sets of tees ranging from 7,540 yards to 5,630.
How can any Senator vote for Hagel as Sec.
of Defense after that horrific hearing?
He is not up for the job but will probably get it.
Magician extraordinaire @pennjillette is back in the All-Star @ApprenticeNBC.
This time he has even more tricks up his sleeve.
Always pretend that you’re working for yourself.
You’ll do a wonderful job.
It’s simple, but it works.
Have confidence, work hard, and keep your focus on the small things that matter while keeping the big picture in mind.
To all young college graduates – stick in there, keep your head up and make sure you don’t miss any opportunities.
They are out there.
Will the Keystone XL pipeline finally be approved?
Will create over 100,000 jobs and make us more energy independent.
The President’s speech tonight will largely focus on class warfare.
The Republicans don’t know how to handle that—I do.
Surprised @Eagles signed Michael Vick yesterday to be their 2013 QB.
Vick is  talented but brittle & probably won't last long.
I don’t know what will happen with the lawsuit against dummy @billmaher but have an obligation to charity to bring it.
Check @billmaher’s background & you will find he is not a smart guy—he just wants people to think he is--just call him dummy.
I went to Wharton, made over $8 billion, employ thousands of people & get insulted by morons who can’t get enough of me on twitter...!
NY should frack now.
What’s the hold up?
Is Albany opposed to creating jobs and making gas cheaper for middle class?
Every business has surprises, hidden dangers beneath the surface, and little known opportunities that can lead to huge success.
When will people realize that @billmaher is not an intellectual, but actually a rather dumb guy—just look at his past.
Pay attention to global news and developments--in today's world that is a requirement, not an elective.
Gain and use information to your advantage--see every day as an opportunity to learn.
Marco Rubio is being crucified by the media for drinking water during speech!
Next time Marco Rubio should drink his water from a glass as opposed to a bottle—would have much less negative impact.
Looking forward to being interviewed on the @marklevinshow tonight at 6:30 PM EST.
Be sure to listen!
@SenRandPaul’s Tea Party rebuttal to Obama’s SOTU explained why limited government promotes freedom.
Well done!
She’s back!
Champion @Joan_Rivers returns to the boardroom in this year’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC.
Joan is ferocious.
Speaking to a record crowd of over 20,000 people in Charlotte Arena this Saturday morning—look forward to it!
Whatever you are doing right now, make sure to stop for a minute, focus and ask yourself “Am I thinking BIG?
Be focused, be disciplined, be patient--there are very few cases of instant gratification.
You've got something unique to offer--find out what it is.
Ask yourself: What can I provide that does not yet exist?
Innovation can follow..
What is the standard for which you want to be known?
Identify that standard and follow it.
It is important to think positively.
Negative thinking will kill your focus and destroy any chance you have of being successful.
If US Air & American Airlines are allowed to merge, ticket prices will skyrocket—there will  be no competition.
Paying attention is a cost effective way of protecting yourself and your interests.
Remember to think big by expanding your horizons at the same time you’re expanding your net worth.
Really enjoyed my interview with @marklevinshow.
He is terrific!
If US Air and American Airlines are allowed to merge, we are back to the days of “monopoly”.
I believe in free markets but allowing a merger of US Air & American Airlines is totally ridiculous!
Will control most of US market.
Everyone's favorite frontman, Twisted Sister  lead singer @deesnider returns to this year’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC.
Dee does great!
The Tea Party is filled with great Americans..
@GOP need to face reality – not one of the illegal immigrants granted amnesty will vote Republican.
In my office with Banana Joe, who just won the @WKCDOGS at @MSGnyc.
Obama vacationing in West Palm Beach starting tomorrow.
Thanks for all the great comments on all my recent interviews.
Much appreciated.
Take responsibility for yourself--it's a very empowering attitude.
If you can count the amount of time you put into a project on your fingers, then you haven’t spent enough time on it.
Success is good.
Success with significance is even better.
Work on what you will be proud to be associated with--make your work count.
Remember, if you don't promote yourself, then no one else will!
Likewise, believe in yourself--or no one else will either.
I never want someone working for me who doesn’t want to be there--and in the same way, you shouldn’t want to be there, either.
All-Star @ApprenticeNBC has done the impossible.
TV's greatest villain @OMAROSA & @THEGaryBusey are in competition.
Fireworks!
Trump National Golf Club, Charlotte, is the premiere club in North Carolina.
The American-US Airways merger will create even worse service and much higher fares.
People have been asking to hear my Howard Stern interview—you can access it on @HowardTV.
Chuck Hagel’s nomination has been held up for at least 12 more days.
A lot can happen.
Looks like @bwilliams is having some problems with his Rock Center with Brian Williams show--I hate to see such bad ratings for @NBC.
Wow—Family Feud said I am the third most envied man in America.
I respectfully disagree—I am very modest.
If I’m the third most envied man in America, the small group of haters and losers must be nauseas.
Great going.
I said gas prices would sky rocket after election - Opec payback!
I am surprised that Hugo Chavez can keep power in his weak physical condition!
Jerry Buss was a great guy and friend.
He will be missed!
Be tenacious.
Being tenacious means you're tough and patient at once--a formidable combination.
Listen and learn from others but make your own decisions.
Use your instincts--you alone know where you want to go.
My @foxandfriends interview discussing Pres.
Great to see @Yankees Captain Derek Jeter back on the field.
He will have another great season and make NYC proud again.
All-Star @ApprenticeNBC, premiering March 3rd on @NBC, features terrific TV stars competing in the toughest tasks yet.
Will be great.
Dianne Gallagher @DianneG is a great reporter for News Channel 36 in Charlotte, NC.
Fantastic interview--thanks!
Idiot @billmaher always forgets to mention that I am suing him to collect the $5M for charity, that he expressly offered.
$5 a gallon gas and we have yet to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.
OPEC is laughing at us.
The many losers and haters never have the brains or stamina to become truly successful!
Too many people rely on auto correct...
an assistant of mine apologizes!
Achievers move forward at all times.
Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
Re: Success-- Don't put blinders on and do not limit yourself; reach out, seek and explore.
Think big at all times.
Review your work habits & make sure they are taking you in the right direction.
Don't tread water--get out there and go for it.
Dummy @GoAngelo who had 11 people show up for 15 min.
My ties & shirts at Macy’s are doing great.
Stupid @GoAngelo is making people aware of how good they are!
Looks like a lawsuit against GoAngelo won’t work—my ties & shirts doing too well at Macy’s--he's actually helping.
I have no damages!
While I fully agree, it is not politically correct!
I’m really saddened to see that @Cher was voted “the 4th ugliest celebrity” according to @listverse....
The Oscar Pistorius disaster is a really interesting story to me—a very sad situation for everyone!
@DianneG @WCNC  To the “news bigs” --  elevate Dianne Gallagher  immediately—she is terrific!
Former winner @bretmichaels  returns to All-Star @ApprenticeNBC March 3rd on @NBC.
Bret shows once again why he is a champion!
I had amazing time in Charlotte.
Great people & many new friends.
I look forward to coming back very soon.
Congrats to Gavin & Staff.
I am hearing that @NRCC Digital Director @lansing is doing great work expanding and modernizing @GOP social media.
Good – we need it.
It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it....
and an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties".
THE APPRENTICE.
- 10 years, 182 shows - many at number one for week or night -Amazing!
Wow, Macy's numbers just in-Trump is doing better than ever - thanks for your great support!
@mcuban, you were excellent on Howard Stern...
thanks for the nice comments about my kids...
yours are winners also!
John McCain had a really hard time with his town hall meeting on immigration.
They really went after him!
Republicans must be careful with immigration—don’t give our country away.
If you think we have a problem with Social Security and Medicare now, try taking in millions of new citizens all at once.
My Twitter has been seriously hacked--- and we are looking for the perpetrators.
Only 10 more days until the premiere of All-Star @ApprenticeNBC.
On March 3rd at 9PM EST @NBC the fireworks return to the Board Room!
Twitter will soon be irrelevant if lowlifes are so easily able to hack into accounts.
Congrats to Miss Universe 2011 @RealLeilaLopes & @Giant great @OsiUmenyiora on their engagement!
I am very happy for you both.
China is not our friend.
They are not our ally.
They want to overtake us, and if we don’t get smart and tough soon, they will....
It is all about incorporating a sense of optimism into everything you do while also acknowledging the negative”.
Drew Peterson just got 36 years for killing his wife - bring back the death penalty!
I've just done a major Dateline for NBC - March 3rd just ahead of Apprentice.
What would All-Star @ApprenticeNBC be w/out a Baldwin?
@StephenBaldwin7 is at the top of his game this season.
Our fans will be happy....
Will be there front & center along with the 70 greatest players in the world.
Enjoyed my visit to Trump Doral in Miami yesterday.
Looking forward to returning for the WGC-@Cadillac Championship on March 6th-10th...
The PGA tour just extended my Trump Doral contract for WGC for ten years.
Vince McMahon @WWE and I hold the all-time ratings & pay-per-view record in the history of wrestling....
Doesn’t seem like they have a coherent strategy right now.
For the Republicans to have any success these next two years, they must have a long game plan then he who continues the attack wins”.
Lance Armstrong is now being sued by Fed Govt-what was he thinkking?
I will be on@gretawire tonight at 10 P.M. Now I know she will get great ratings!
I hope Oprah gives Lance Armstrong 100 million dollars because that's what that ridiculous interview will cost him!
Republicans better start listening to and respecting the Tea Party!
Big response to my Tea Party statement-remember they were never fully energized by Romney campaign and will have far more power with time.
Why didn't movie Lincoln use Ford's Theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater?
I'm saying that the Tea Party, perhaps by another name, will soon have another big moment- and will be a major factor in victory!
By popular demand, I will be tweeting on the very tainted Academy Awards tonight!
Come on goAngelo, don't give up now just because your "rally" at Macy's drew only eleven people for twenty minutes!
I love@ Macy's.
Dummy goAngelo, keep letting people know how great my shirts, ties and cufflinks (also Success) are at Macy's.
The BEST-now everyone's aware!
Congrats to @JimmieJohnson, a great guy, on winning Daytona!
Here we go with the Oscars!
How do you like Seth and Oscars so far?
I don't like the opening even a little bit!
You are right-more like the opening of the Tonys.
Django Unchained is the most racist movie I have ever seen, it sucked!
Very tacky set!
Shirley B did a very good job singing Goldfinger!
Not easy.
Lincoln never sounded like that!
Anne Hathaway is a good winner!
Sorry, I never went bankrupt and don't wear a wig (it's all mine)!
The Oscar broadcast is really boring - where is the glamour and beauty?
Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas look great!
I've had enough of this - good night!
I'll be doing Fox and Friends this morning at seven....
Overall, the Academy Awards were very average at best.
Last night William Shatner had more airtime than any winner.
It should have been called the William Shatner show...
How did you like Michelle Obama’s bangs last night?
Why do losers & haters always say I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t.
Like it or not, it’s all mine—just ask Barbara Walters.
Whenever one of the morons say I wear a wig, stop reading because they have no credibility & just hate.....
It is a very effective & commonly used business tool.
People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals..
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
Speaker John Boehner, who I like, should never have agreed to raise taxes because the Republicans got absolutely nothing for it!
The media is so in the tank for Obama that it is amazing—the funny thing is, he can’t stand them!
So far, he has been a complete failure at doing so.
He should read The Art of the Deal and use his energy to focus on a new career.
An individual, whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns, has turned his attention to me......
@MarissaMayer is right to expect Yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs.
working at home.
She is doing a great job!
Obama is making speeches excoriating the Republicans, and they never answer back.
Why aren’t they fighting?
The $85B sequester is just 2% of Obama's $3.5T record deficit spending budget.
Our leaders are ruining our children's future.
The countdown is on.
The 13th season of All-Star @ApprenticeNBC premieres this Sunday March 3rd at 9PM EST on @nbc.
Big!
Our leaders are terrible.
The government spends over $50B a day.
It can’t find cuts for less than 2 days of spending?!
Sad!
Shark Tank is a dead Friday night filler compared to the Apprentice which has been number one show for week in the T. V. ratings!
The United States better address China's exchange rate before they steal our country and it is too late!
China is laughing at us.
Now I know that Yahoo is in good hands.
It took great courage for @marissamayer to take away the right of employees to work at home....
Also, if they’re at home who the hell knows what they’re doing (a second job maybe).
When employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group ..
I wonder if Angelo has a job or is on assistance.
In any event, I'm sure he is a nice guy!
A certain whack job, Go Angelo, who doesn't have a life- spends his time hopelessly attacking me re: Macy's .
you keep forgetting to mention the fragrance, "Success"!
at Madison Square Garden followed by a ceremony with 80,000 people at MetLife Stadium, Wrestlemania.
It is a great honor for me to be inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame.
This will take place on April 6  and pay per view records with “Battle of the Billionaires” in Detroit.
It was a wild day!
One of the reasons, I assume, I was inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame is that Vince McMahon and I have the all time highest ratings...
I will be on @LateNightJimmy tonight.
Always have a good time with @jimmyfallon.
Now we know he will get high ratings tonight.
Country music star @TraceAdkins returns to All-Star @CelebApprentice.
Competing for @RedCross, Trace is great!
Just a few more days until the 13th season of All-Star @CelebApprentice premieres.
Be sure to tune in this Sunday at 9PM on @nbc.
Big!
There is no comparison between @ApprenticeNBC and Shark Tank in the ratings.
The Apprentice beats Shark Tank hands...
The ruling @GOP consultant class of losers like @KarlRove have no respect for the Tea Party.
They do this at their own peril!
You have to feel bad for the Democrat Senators.
They don’t want Hagel either.
Just following Obama’s orders..
@tedcruz must be doing something right if @cher, sadly rated “the 4th ugliest celebrity” according to @listverse, is attacking him.
Looking forward to the @CadillacChamp at Trump Doral next week, 3.6.
-3.10.
Can’t wait to meet the attendees.
Dopey @billmaher still owes me $5M for charity.
I hope he pays up before @hbo fires him--which will happen!
On Jimmy Fallon tonight.
Why does@ Bill O'Reilly keep putting Karl Rove on his show-a total waste of time.
Rove spent $400, 000, 000 and didn't win a race-pathetic!
Jimmy Fallon show will be great tonight - I'm on!
I'll bet Jimmy Fallon gets great ratings tonight!
Will be on Howard Stern at 6.45 A.M. and the Today Show at 8.
Just did Howard Stern Show-great time.
Now doing The Today Show with Ivanka.
ENJOY!
Heading over to@Kelly and Michael re.
Apprentice!
@GoAngelo—the next time you have a rally @Macy’s, try getting 12 people instead of 11—it would be much more effective!
Many people have commented that my fragrance, “Success”  is the best scent & lasts the longest.
Try it & let me know what you think!
…..
Guy in front asked for picture- said he was the biggest fan, never saw the guy in back.
Was photo bombed yesterday by a wise guy when I left the set of @LateNightJimmy....
@IvankaTrump and me at the @todayshow this morning....
and says something is seriously wrong.
He will never go down as great!
The Pope should not have resigned—he should have lived it out.
It hurts him, it hurts the church...
Great news - @BarbaraJWalters has fully recovered and will be back on @theviewtv this coming Monday.
Barbara is wonderful!
Everyone loves TV’s darling @TheRealMarilu.
But wait until you see her tough & competitive side in the upcoming @CelebApprentice!
Is everything ok over there @Salon?
I actually got some good press from them today.
The Trump Doral's @cadillacchamp is Florida’s premiere golf-tournament.
I'll be there!
There was a major diplomatic breakthrough yesterday w/the White House, Iran & China.
All celebrated Chuck Hagel being voted in as SOD.
What is wrong with the @GOP?
Isn’t it ironic that President Obama, of all people, is pushing for ‘universal background checks?!
The government will spend over $3.8T this year.
The sequester is a pittance of the outlays, less than 2%.
Where’s the problem?
the ratings of Shark Tank.
Everyone was hitting on me until the numbers came in—and now—dead silence!
How come nobody mentions that the Nielsen Ratings of the Apprentice, after 12 seasons-- as shown by Howard Stern --totally blow away  Rove’s ad campaign has made Ashley Judd a totally credible candidate.
Be careful Mitch!
If Mitch McConnell wants to win his election, he’d better get rid of jinxed Karl Rove and fast...
Ashley Judd has just thanked Karl Rove for all the attention he has given her—unreal!
—how stupid can we get?
Karl Rove’s stupid ad made Ashley Judd hot—now everybody is talking about her.
Karl Rove’s ads are the worst in political history!
@StephenBaldwin7 and me at a press event for All-Star @ApprenticeNBC earlier today at @TrumpTowerNY.....
@DeeSnider, @StephenBaldwin7, and the rest of your favorites are back!
All-Star @ApprenticeNBC premieres Sunday...
Be sure to watch “The History of WrestleMania” on @netflix.
My interview explains how I supported the event early on.
I'm proud of it.
Everyone is excited for @THEGaryBusey’s return to All-Star @CelebApprentice.
Be warned, this time Gary is even more insane!
I am very proud of @StephenBaldwin7’s performance in the record 13th season of All-Star @CelebApprentice.
Watch.
Remember, no one ever said success was easy.
Good luck doesn’t come overnight.
But if u work hard & love it, u will find success & luck.
One good aspect of the Obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers.
If you can make it now, you deserve it!
Over the years, I've discovered that for a brand to build, the people surrounding it have to work exceptionally well together.
You haven’t seen fireworks until you see @OMAROSA & @piersmorgan go at it again!
Are you a Democrat running in a race you should lose?
Get @KarlRove to run an ad against you and you will win.
Do  not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a  trail.
Thank you - so nice.
Erin Burnett, who has no ratings on CNN in prime time, now wants more money to move to the morning slot.
@CNN should say "no way".
It is going to be a long and tough road to turn around CNN - they are looking at the wrong people!
Thanks Matthew!
By popular request,  I will be live tweeting during Celebrity Apprentice (Sunday 9 P.M.).
I am happy that "The Job" on CBS, the 16th.
knockoff of the Apprentice, was just cancelled.
I love to see my opponents lose (not nice)!
Pay attention to details.
If you don't know every aspect of what you're doing, you're setting yourself up for some big surprises.
Remember, this Sunday I am also featured on @datelinenbc at 8PM, right before the premiere of All-Star @CelebApprentice @nbc likes me!
Newly minted diplomat @dennisrodman is a completely different competitor in All-Star @CelebApprentice.
Dennis is a legend!
Continued success is built on building a brand people know will deliver.
Unless you’re @KarlRove.
Then you just blame the Tea Party.
We should leave Afghanistan immediately.
No more wasted lives.
If we have to go back in, we go in hard & quick.
Rebuild the US first.
Due to popular demand, @lisarinna returns to the 13th season of All-Star @CelebApprentice.
Lisa's fans won't be disappointed!
Today marks the one year anniversary of @AndrewBreitbart’s passing.
Andrew’s mission & legacy still lives on.
Only the Obama WH can get away with attacking Bob Woodward.
Who would have thought that an @ApprenticeNBC champion would return to compete?
@bretmichaels returns to All-Star @CelebApprentice...
Champion @Joan_Rivers loves being on the other side of the table in the Boardroom.
She leaves no punches out in @CelebApprentice!
If  people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it wouldn't seem so wonderful  at all.
Joseph Kennedy is really being used by Venezuela and Hugo C. in oil commercial!
Everyone should cancel HBO until they fire low life dummy Bill Maher!
Get going now and feel good about yourself!
Remember, Bill Maher praised the animals who took down the World Trade Center and was fired by ABC.
DROP@HBO until dopey Bill is canned!
Is Chris Jackson as dumb as I hear - but I still like that he follows me like a good little soldier!
Really bad article about me in the dying (or dead) Esquire Magazine.
Totally false - lots of hatred.
When will this boring magazine close?
Everybody wants to see and talk to Dennis Rodman - he will be on Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9.
Losers and haters are invited to watch Celebrity Apprentice along with the many great and productive people in the hope that you will learn.
Losers and haters,even you, as low and dumb as you are, can learn from watching Apprentice and checking out my tweets-you can still succeed!
How does this cast look to you?
Pretty amazing.
Looks like @OMAROSA is up to the challenge..
@LisaRinna looks better with her reduced lips.
Good move, Lisa.
I always believed @BretMichaels was making a mistake in coming back as a competitor.
I disagree with him but...
I can’t believe he would choose @OMAROSA as his first choice!
She is hard to handle..
@IvankaTrump and @PiersMorgan will be wonderful advisors..
@PiersMorgan and @OMAROSA really hate each other..
@THEGaryBusey is definitely different..
@DennisRodman must be thinking of North Korea..
@KellyandMichael are both wonderful people.
Their show is terrific..
@OMAROSA as a cashier- a big mistake by @BrandenRoderick.
Even @PiersMorgan is impressed by @THEGaryBusey.
Paul Teutul is always good on the show.
Don't worry West Coast etc.
we are not going to tweet who was fired or give any indication there of until after it airs..
@IvankaTrump looks like a movie star from the days of glamour and beauty..
@PiersMorgan is right- he won the show because “I know how to play the game”.
I'll always like @OMAROSA because she constantly defends me.
So, what did you think of my decision?
What would you have done?
I will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 A.M. this morning.
Brande would have been fired immediately if she didn't raise $132,000, a really large sum.
Bret, on the other hand, raised very little Brande was also smart in not bringing Omarosa to the boardroom.
Glad everyone could see Mar-a-Lago last night on @datelinenbc.
It is the crown jewel of Palm Beach..
@CelebApprentice wins 10-11 o’clock hour in all key ratings demographics, including, most importantly, the 18-49 age group.
Each week, you the audience can choose an MVP among the celebrities @CelebApprentice using Twitter…...
For those of you defending Bret and saying Omarosa should go remember Bret chose O which could also be considered a big mistake!
Heading to Trump National Doral to check the progress prior to the start of the Cadillac Championship on Thursday.
Rory, Tiger, Phil and Ernie will be fun to watch this weekend at Trump National Doral.
Remember--the worst thing you can do in a negotiation is seem desperate to make the deal.
The Formula of Knowledge: The best way to learn is through studying the history of success and failures in your industry.
Just arrived at Trump National Doral, saying hello to all the great players.
This place is amazing.
Come Thursday & see for yourselves!
Ernie Els and myself at Trump National Doral.
It’s important to promote an image of yourself each and every day.
It’s part of having a sense of self and a sense of purpose.
It is my great honor to be speaking at CPAC 2013.
They are all about what's good for America.
Building a brand is like building a skyscraper-the foundation comes first.
It was just announced that @MacMiller’s song “DonaldTrump” went platinum—tell  Mac Miller to kiss my ass!
Without momentum there’s a lack of energy that can lead the best of ideas to nowhere.
Get your momentum going-- and keep it going.
Dateline NBC, featuring yours truly, just set a season high in households in the ratings—no wonder NBC likes me so much!
@somelikeitlar hope you enjoyed the premiere of All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC.
Make sure @marklevinshow watches!
It’s been great making so many new friends at Trump @DoralResort for the @CadillacChamp.
Good luck to everyone!
John Heilemann, the lightweight reporter begging to be on@morning joe, looks like a timebomb waiting to explode-he's a nervous and sad mess!
I don't know why but I feel so sorry for dummy reporter John Heilemann when I watch him on television.
Go to Trump National Doral, Miami, and watch Tiger, Phil, Ernie, Rory and all of the other great players compete in The WGC Cadillac Champ!
Re: Decisions:  Cover your bases, then ask yourself this question: "What am I pretending not to see"?
This can save a lot of time & trouble.
Notice the first word in my Think Big credo: Think = the 1st step.
Use everything in your power to utilize & develop that capacity.
Golf is a brain game & is a great way to improve your business skills.
Concentration,assessment, technique & passion...
it's all there.
Make sure to tune in to All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC this Sunday at 9PM EST for another round of fireworks and surprises!
Resolve to be bigger than your problems.
Who’s the boss?
Realize that fear is the exact opposite of faith.
Get the big picture but be prepared for the picture to change.
Be persistent and alert every single day.
How much is South Korea paying the U.S. for protection against North Korea????
NOTHING!
I'm at Trump Doral right now, Tiger will tee off shortly.
I will be live tweeting during the @ApprenticeNBC tonight at 9PM ET.
That was some episode last week-we've got a great cast!
Bret had a target on his back from the get go...
There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa.
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $.
Looks like a good season for charities.
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
Will Plan B miss Trace?
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM?
Smooth sailing is not expected.
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC:  American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work.
What do you think of Gary's definition of    f-u-n?
Gary as the Cat in the Hat?
He can work it out.
On the whole, the teams seem to be working well together.
No wars...
yet.
What?!
LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....
is somebody confused?
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept & presentation.
Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary, while 'adorable', is a distraction?
Re Omarosa: Nasty, tough or smart...
or all?
Which team is your favorite?
It's true...
Dennis is really into this-very animated.
I have never seen him this way before.
Re my hair-Should I change it?
What do you think?
The losing team is now back in boardroom.
I can't discuss the team members or what's going on or what happens from here on out.
Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate..
My @foxandfriends int.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be.
Now put the foundations under them.
To @TigerWoods  He is truly a great champion and we were honored to have him at Trump National Doral..
@deesnider is a great guy & a total winner!
He understood - he did not leave me any other choice.
Look forward to keeping in touch.
Between a terrible press conference, mishandled prisoner swap & Taliban attacks, Hagel's 1st trip as SOD was a disaster.
No surprise.
According to new employment numbers, 296,000 Americans have dropped out of the work force & gave up looking for work.
Really looking forward to my address @CPACnews this Friday morning at 8:30.
Will stress jobs, etc.
Can't wait to see my many friends..
@Graeme_McDowell  Great playing this weekend.
You are a true winner.
We look forward to having you back to Trump National Doral.
Our economy has had worst recovery under Obama since the Depression.
Results of his policies speak for themselves.
No new taxes!
Re: Ashley Judd: Keep @KarlRove away.
He already made her a viable candidate.
All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC continues to dominate the Sunday 10PM slot in every key demographic.
Still hot after 13 seasons!
Glad to hear @ehasselbeck will be staying on @theviewtv.
Elizabeth has great presence & doesn’t back down from sharing her views.
Congratulations to @NewYorkObserver on celebrating its 25 year anniversary.
Great paper under amazing management!
My @CPACnews speech is scheduled Friday at 8:45AM in the Potomac Ballroom.
Will also be telecast live on CSPAN & cable news networks.
Hamas has warned Pres....
The ads made her look great and now she probably will run.
Ashley Judd's candidacy was created by Karl Rove's terrible ads, even before she thought seriously about running...
Autism Speaks, head up by Bob & Suzanne Wright, does a fantastic job—if only we had more people like them!
Help save the lives of our troops.
It’s sad that the WH is punishing children from across the country by closing all tours.
Doesn’t have to be.
WH should take my offer.
Lines for my @CPACnews address start at 7:00AM outside the Potomac Ballroom.
ACU has asked that you get there early.
The sequester is less than 2% of total 2013 budget.
Why can’t the WH re-allocate funds and keep the tours open for children?
@CPACnews had its largest ever ticket sales the day of my announcement.
Really an honor.
Can’t wait to see everyone..
Best of luck to my good friend Derek Jeter on his first game today back at shortstop.
@Yankees Captain is a warrior & winner.
In making any decision, you need all the facts.
But after exhausting all due diligence, in the end you have to go with your gut!
Do your homework.
Wasting other people’s time due to poor planning and thoughtlessness will only leave a bad impression.
Celebrity Apprentice will be rebroadcast tonight at 9 on CNBC.
I watched Mark Cuban on Jay Leno last night - what a jerk!
Congrats to @EricTrump and @LaraLeaYunaska on a great five years!
Dummy @mcuban made up a story about a visit to Mar-a-Lago last night on Leno.
It never happened—I don’t talk that way.....
Do I get the credit for this?
Thank you!
Wow--just 1 day after my offer to fund all WH tours "Obama backtracks on decision to cancel all White House tours” ...
The DC press corps is obsessed with my @CPACnews speech which is scheduled  tomorrow 8:45AM in the Potomac Ballroom.
Can't blame them.
To show you how shallow politicians can be, many are jealous of my @CPACnews speaking slot & also their fellow Republicans!
Not good!
Congratulations to my Catholic friends on the selection of Pope Francis I to lead the Catholic Church.
People that know him love him!
@BarbaraJWalters made a great decision in firing @JoyVBehar from @theviewtv.
The show will be better without her!
Good move by @MSNBC in downgrading @WeGotEd to a dead weekend spot.
This is truly a guy who shouldn't be on tv.
I love watching dummy @mcuban promote on ok show named Shark Tank—but he is just a small part of that show.
When @mcuban had his own show, The Benefactor, it totally “bombed!
CPAC attendees & fellow patriots - lines for my @CPACnews start at 7:00AM outside the Potomac Ballroom.
Make sure to get there early!
There’s a reason @mcuban’s partners can’t stand him and on top of that, the team sucks!
Those stupid people bought @mcuban's company (of which he owned a piece)..
@mcuban has less TV persona than  any other person I can think of.
He’s an arrogant, crude, dope who met some very stupid people...
When you think big, you will automatically trigger more details because details are the major component of making anything big.
The CPAC speech went really well this morning--- first speaker--- standing ovation.
I really enjoyed it.
Press conference after CPAC speech this morning was excellent- lots of very professional reporters.
I watched the last two minutes of the @dallasmavs game last night--- I just loved watching them lose......
He knows I don’t respect him.
Boring & failing @NYMag’s 3rd rate political reporter @jheil had flunky @DanAmira write a totally false report about me today @DailyCaller, @BreitbartNews, @DRUDGE_REPORT & @gatewaypundit.
For accurate reporting of my @CPACnews speech, read @PoliticalTicker, @Newsmax_Media, @politico, @HuffPostPol....
WHY CAN'T THE MEDIA TELL THE TRUTH - WE WOULD ALL BE SO MUCH BETTER OFF!
I agreed to take the worst spot at CPAC because nobody else wanted it and it was the only time I could be there - it was great fun!
Honest reporters stated that the Prayer Breakfast was going on during my CPAC speech and security was very slow to let people in-long lines!
Thanks for all of the accolades on my speech today - it's all about the truth!
Huff Post "His early morning speech drew a large crowd, far larger than remarks at the same time on Thursday" and packed by end!
The facts.
Wow-Record ratings for WGC Cadillac Championship at Trump National Doral's Blue Monster-Most watched in seven years.
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 on NBC - GREAT EPISODE!
Last weeks Dateline, which I hosted, was the highest rated Dateline since January!
Best ratings for the Dateline show were for six months, not two months!
I'll be tweeting live tonight starting at 9PM ET re:@ApprenticeNBC.
Don't worry other time zones, I will give nothing away!
The tournament at Trump National Doral was much more exciting than what is going on now!
@Omarosa’s meltdown—was it for real?
Great line from @TheGaryBusey:  “I am an angel in an earth suit”.
Do you agree?
@Omarosa has another meltdown … while giving a check for $40,000 to Michael’s charity, the Sue Duncan Center.
The Paley Center for Media is a great place to visit when you’re in NYC..
And happy to welcome @ArsenioHall back as an advisor— he will have his own show and is doing great..
@Omarosa on the cover of Soap Opera Digest?
Music cues, audience participation, sounds like a very active Team Power.
There’s no love lost between @latoyajackson  & @OMAROSA Disrespectful?
Who is being disrespectful?
@latoyajackson informs @ArsenioHall  that @Omarosa is a “conniving witch”—is he surprised?
Are we surprised?
@Omarosa’s emergency has put a new spin on Team Power’s presentation—but it’s not “show time” yet..
@Omarosa’s new name via @DennisRodman: “Ms. Saboteur” sounds rather elegant..
@Omarosa is not winning points, being called “the wicked witch of the Mid-West” and most certainly other things..
@DennisRodman re @Omarosa is right, she’s becoming predictable.
True, @THEGaryBusey is a scene stealer without trying.
He’s got a gift.
I will not be commenting on boardroom specifics- would be unfair to the different time zones..
If @OMAROSA is not in the Board Room, I can’t fire her.
@latoyajackson made a strategic mistake.
Vattenfall, the company behind a proposed asinine windfarm off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, is having serious financial difficulty.
Vattenfall CEO stated that the company needed to prepare itself for falling electricity demands in coming years-- a  changing market.
Scotland will be so lucky if this monstrosity is not built—I will tie them up in courts for years, if necessary..
@DLoesch played great audio from my @CPACnews press conference on her radio show.
Glad she made it!
The Blue Monster is being torn up at Trump @DoralResort.
On April 1, I go out & play it one more time until the new course opens.
New @RNC report calls for embracing “comprehensive immigration reform”.
Why does @mcuban continue to embarrass the 31-35 & 11TH place @dallasmavs with childish behavior?
Really unprofessional!
@dallasmavs is 1-12 against the Western Conference’s top four seeds after Sunday’s loss & @okcthunder swept the season series.
Sexual pervert & deviant Anthony Weiner is polling to see if he can run for NYC Mayor...
Is Anthony Weiner also delusional?
Add him to NY Sex Offender list instead!
Apprentice ratings doing great - easily won the 10 o'clock hour over other networks!
Golf match?
I've won 18 Club Championships including this weekend.
@mcuban swings like a little girl with no power or talent.
Bombings all over Iraq today.
That country is falling apart-such a horrible waste of lives and 1.5 trillion dollars (and I told you so!
).
WHO IS GOING TO GET IRAQ'S OIL???????
@mcuban is so short off the tee he can't have much of a punch.
He's just a weak man with a big mouth!
But @mcuban is physically weak, he has no clubhead speed or game!
@rushlimbaugh is right—the Republicans lost because they weren’t conservative enough—or tough enough.
Be weak on immigration and ensure Democratic victory..
@rushlimbaugh played 3 separate audio bites (the most of anyone) of my CPAC speech.
Hour 3 in Friday's show.
I was sorry to decline headlining the Reagan Dinner last Saturday due to a prior business commitment.
Pres.
Reagan was one of the greats.....
to help McConnell, who spoke right after him”.
Re: CPAC “The crowd in the main room filled to capacity by the end of Trump’s address, something his operative said he planned to do....
@hardball_chris  is a really dumb guy(and I know him well)—that’s why he works swimmingly with our leaders in Washington.
I don’t like seeing the Pope standing at the checkout counter (front desk) of a hotel in order to pay his bill.
It’s not Pope-like!
It was great having @ArsenioHall back on this week's @ApprenticeNBC!
l still think @Boeing should just bite the bullet & get rid of the new batteries in the 787.
Those batteries will always be a problem!
For beauty and flight, I’ll take the @Boeing 757 over the @Boeing 787 any day!
@ErinBurnett should have stayed at CNBC—she was never smart, but people liked her.
@OutFrontCNN Jeff Zucker’s got problems!
@hardball_chris became a super liberal Obama fan only because he must need the money--and on @MSNBC that’s the way it is..
@SarahPalinUSA did a great job @CPACnews.
Much of what she said was plain old "common sense".
It was just announced that @ErinBurnett won’t be going to mornings on CNN.
@OutFrontCNN just made a wise decision.
All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC continues to surprise our loyal viewers each and every week.
Sorry folks, but Donald Trump is far richer and much better looking than dopey @mcuban!
Why do shows have @ananavarro—Ntl Hispanic Chair for the losing McCain ’08 & Huntsman ’12.
She’s a loser who doesn’t deliver votes.
Does anyone remember the fight @mcuban had w/ the referee—he was weak & pathetic—a non-athlete trying to live life thru his players..
@RNC report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election.
Short on ideas.
Just giving excuses to donors.
Amnesty is suicide for Republicans.
Not one of those 12 million who broke our laws will vote Republican.
Obama is laughing at @GOP.
Iran will soon control Iraq & its oil.
Congratulations to @Likud_Party MK @dannydanon on being offered Deputy Defense Minister of IDF by @IsraeliPM @netanyahu.
Passion motivates.
Passionate people don't give up; their zeal eliminates fear.
Passion can also create business opportunities..
@mcuban  Mark, okay with me but don't start your bullshit again!
@hardball_chris’ very small audience is shrinking rapidly because people finally understand that he is very very dumb!
I remained strong for @TigerWoods during his difficult period.
He rewarded me (and himself) by winning at Trump National Doral..
@NBC just announced that all 1 hour @CelebApprentice episodes are being expanded to 2 hours—it’s amazing what good ratings will do!
It’s a shame to hear that the @dcexaminer is failing.
No one wants the paper, even if it is being handed out for free.
Board Room finale of this week’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC will leave viewers wondering where the rest of the season goes…It's great!
That’s why so many huge deals are closed on a golf course”.
The NFL has just barred ball carriers from using helmet as contact.
What is happening to the sport?
The beginning of the end..
@WWE’s @WrestleMania XXIX less than 3 weeks away.
Looking forward to being inducted into the Hall of Fame!
@OMAROSA is smart and strategic.
People should cut her some slack and respect the way she works on @ApprenticeNBC.
My shirts, ties & suits (and fragrance, Success) are doing great -- go over & check out Macy’s now—beautiful new selection!
Why do the losers & haters always say I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t.
Like it or not, it’s all mine—just ask Barbara Walters....
It is very effective and a commonly used business tool.
People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals  Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
For the haters, out of hundreds of deals or transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals....
but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
Haters, stop saying I went bankrupt, it is not so.
I never went bankrupt...
The @CelebApprentice will be broadcast tonight on @CNBC at 9 PM.
Celebrity Apprentice on CNBC tonight at 9.
Celebrity Apprentice on in 5 minutes on CNBC - it's great!
@mcuban  Mark—nice picture, thanks for the invite to the Mavs/Nets game.
Next time I’ll go and you’ll win!
It’s snowing & freezing in NYC.
What the hell ever happened to global warming?
Remember the golden rule of negotiating: He who has the gold makes the rules.
It won’t stay a buyer’s market forever.
If you can, take advantage and buy property asap.
You’ll thank me!
Yes, All-Star @ApprenticeNBC contestant @THEGaryBusey is a little out there.
But he uses his ‘uniqueness’ to his advantage.
Problem with @GOP is not their message, it’s that they are incapable of controlling the message.
Make no mistake, Obamacare is the first step towards changing our health system into single payer.
Just a disaster.
Life always presents new opportunities you would never expect.
I hosted @WrestleMania & then I starred in one, which sold most PPVs.
There won’t be any new gun legislation.
No surprise.
Americans support the 2nd amendment.
See yourself as an organization.
Pay attention to every facet of your life.
What’s strong?
What’s weak?
What’s missing?
When I think big, which is often, you can be sure I’m aware of the enormous amount of little things that we will have to account for..
@MichelleMalkin would be nothing without being on the @seanhannity show.
I don’t see what Sean sees in her—loser!
This Sunday's All-Star @ApprenticeNBC features some of the biggest fireworks of the entire season.
Get ready.
Watching the madness in Cyprus?
If our government keeps spending trillion dollar deficits, that could happen here..
Looks like the U.S. will be having the coldest March since 1996-global warming anyone?????????
Don't blindly pursue a career that others suggest or insist is right for you.
It may be worth taking a pay cut for a job you love.
Wow - they are really killing Jay Leno - let him go out with dignity!
Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 on NBC - some amazing things happen!
I will be tweeting live tonight during Celebrity Apprentice - 9 o'clock on NBC!
Last week’s boardroom was truly epic ---and the dust hasn’t settled yet..
@LaToyaJackson & @Omarosa are not likely to become friends –ever!
@StephenBaldwin7’s mother thinks I’m very handsome.
Now I see where Stephen and Alec get their smarts.
Always good to have @ArsenioHall back as advisor as well as @DonaldJTrumpJr.
They have their own fan clubs at this point..
@StephenBaldwin7 thinks @TheRealMarilu is ping-ponging all over the place.
Do you agree?
@Omarosa admitting she’s a threat in the boardroom- that’s not revelation knowledge.
What do you think of @DennisRodman’s Donald Trump head?
The hair’s not quite right, for one thing.
With @TraceAdkins on top of the truck the crowd definitely buzzed.
They should have got Darrell Hammond as the Donald Trump impersonator..
@Joan_Rivers —I know you’re watching- what did you think of your impersonator?
@DennisRodman is always hard to miss-especially when dressed in silver finery.
But not sure about the silver lipstick.
What team would you choose to win?
Who are your favorites on Team Power?
Team Plan B?
People ask about @AmandaTMiller.
She is actually a VP of Marketing at the Trump Organization.
That’s Adrian in the elevator— he works at @TrumpTowerNY & he’s got a lot of stories.
Adrian also gives autographs if you stop by the lobby of @TrumpTowerNY.
What did you think of my decision?
Last night’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC once again showed why the ultimate onus lies with the project manager.
The buck stops there.
Uh oh… @OMAROSA & @piersmorgan once again reunite in the Board Room in next week’s ‘All-Star’ @ApprenticeNBC.
Fireworks!
It’s springtime and it just started snowing in NYC.
What is going on with global warming?
They changed the name from “global warming” to “climate change” after the term global warming just wasn’t working (it was too cold)!
Cyprus is seizing private bank accounts as collateral for €10bn bail-out.
We owe $17T.
Think it can’t happen here?
I hope everyone enjoyed Palm Sunday!
Re: China--I told you that a long time ago.
After decades of our leaders allowing China to steal our jobs & R&D, the Chinese will ‘overtake America’ in 2016 ...
For all of my many Jewish friends, Happy Passover..
@TigerWoods has made a truly great comeback - he is number one again!
Give him credit, comebacks are tough to do.
Way to go Tiger.
The windfarm approval in Scotland is subject to many conditions that can never be met - will be tied up in courts for years!
The radar, defense, shipping and civil aviation problems will stop the ugly windfarm.
…al-Megrahi  was the man who blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The Scottish windfarm was conceived by the same mind that released terrorist al-Megrahi for humanitarian reasons...
The off shore Aberdeen wind farm site is “experimental” & has no track record delivering energy.
When someone can discourage you, you probably aren't determined enough.
Be resolute.
That's what it takes to get things done.
When somebody challenges you, fight back -- be tough!
Many people look at successful people & don't see anything but the end result.
They don't see all the work that went into getting there.
Many of @TigerWoods’ ‘friends’ were quick to abandon him in his time of crisis.
Now Tiger knows who he can count on.
Sometimes we do things to build up experience and stamina to prepare, but it's to prepare us for something bigger.
Great piece on Extra tonight re.
Celebrity Apprentice!
I'm doing The David Letterman Show tonight -should be interesting!
The new selection of ties, shirts and suits at Macy's is amazing - also available in Trump Tower lobby.
General Petraeus should stop apologising and get on with his life.
He is a good man and should have a great future.
The developer of the Scottish wind monstrosities, Vattenfall, just laid off 2,500 people & has serious financial difficulties.
Congrats to fantastic All-Star @ApprenticeNBC celebrity & illusionist @pennjillette on being honored at 2013 Hollywood Walk of Fame!
@pennjillette is an extraordinary entertainer & magician whose star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is long overdue.
Very proud of him..
@EricTrumpFdn continues to do important work for @StJude Children’s Research Hospital.
I am very proud of @EricTrump's philanthropy.
Less than two weeks until @WWE’s @WrestleMania XXIX.
@TheRock v.
@JohnCena willbe epic!
Excited to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.
To all journalists, look into the financial dealings of Scottish Parliament members with Vattenfall…Follow the money.
Aberdeenshire coast is spectacular.
Its historic value & wildlife will be tarnished if these wind turbines are built--but they won't be!
Getting ready to do the David Letterman @Late_Show  tonight—I hope you all will watch—I think!
@alexsalmond @pressjournal RT @GailLorene  Ask our Canadian neighbors who abhor the windfarms.....
to build a wind farm and destroy this view!
@alexsalmond @pressjournal RT @JohnDuthie1 just sitting here looking out over Aberdeen bay.
These clowns cannot be allowed...
Going on Letterman now - let me know what you think - how did I do?
Here we go!
Trump Signature mattress is from Serta - the best there is!
Rambling and stumbling @hardball_chris is as dumb as a rock!
Practice positive thinking—this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary, negative or detrimental At the same time, go through a worst-case scenario but keep it short.
Focus on your goal—look at the solution, not the problem.
Terrible economic numbers released today.
US GDP only grew 0.
Employees of @NYMag should have their resumes updated.
It is very boring & will die in the near future.
How much are they losing now?
Adam Moss, editor in chief of @NYMag is quickly losing his reputation in that @NYMag has become so boring and so irrelevant.
Thanks for all the nice comments about the @Late_Show last night.
I enjoyed it and David enjoyed the ratings.
We blow up the famous Blue Monster at Trump National Doral on.
Monday in order to build a spectacular new, bigger, and better Blue Monster!
Take the time to be thorough in whatever you undertake.
Remain open to new ideas.
Remain fluid, not fixed, in your expectations.
Everybody should contribute & fight in the long haul battle against autism.
This week’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC features another memorable Board Room rumble between @piersmorgan & @OMAROSA.
Wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge.
It's something you can't teach someone else--you have to achieve it on your own.
Achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about.
They have an obligation to best themselves.
Find out who and what is the best in your field.
Identify the trendsetters, leaders and authorities.
Learn the standards they follow.
Have a great Good Friday and a Happy Easter.
Current @NYMag really sad, not only boring but highly inaccurate.
Use better paper product - looks like a death march (which it is!
).
North Korea is reliant on China.
China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders.
What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea?
- NOTHING!
We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't!
China's economy would collapse without us.
China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World, by far.
They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity!
Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG!
Rest of World pays.
No, I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories!
Very sad.
Have a GREAT EASTER, I love you all!
BIG NIGHT on Celebrity Apprentice tonight.
IMPORTANT, starts at 10 P.M. as scheduled but NBC just increased all future episodes to 2 hours!
So, what will happen to the Big O on Celebrity Apprentice tonight.
Remember, I only fire people when it is deserved, not for other reasons!
I hope everyone, or rather almost everyone, had a GREAT EASTER!
What will happen to Omarosa tonight?
One of our all time great episodes!
Are people really afraid of @OMAROSA Would you be?
@claudiajordan’s judgment wasn’t the best in who she chose to come back to the boardroom—that was her demise..
@TrumpNewYork on CPW in NYC is the home of the globe that has become an icon in the city.
Read about how this hotel came into being in my book “Never Give Up”—it’s quite a story..
@piersmorgan is back!
Did I see @OMAROSA wince?
@THEGaryBusey and one of his Busey-isms:  “Art is only the search, it is not the final form”.
Now he has made his Busey-ism into a song..
@LilJon’s take on @piersmorgan seems to be a classic love-hate combo.
Piers can be tough and everyone knows it.
Agreed-- @piersmorgan says he and @OMAROSA have a “communication malfunction”.
Ever see @bluemangroup in performance?
They’re fantastic.
And so are Penn & Teller.
Don’t miss them.
Piers truly hates Omarosa!
Whose artwork was your favorite— and what team do you think will win?
@pennjillette has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame— about time!
@EricTrumpFdn continues to do important work for @StJude Children’s Research Hospital.
I am very proud of @EricTrump's philanthropy.
What do you think @amandatmiller is writing?
Great boardroom!
What did you think?
Adrian was recognized on a Disney cruise and has had many photo requests in @TrumpTowerNY.
We have a new celebrity!
Will be doing Fox and Friends in 10 minutes at 7.05 - enjoy!
@jimmyfallon regularly features @ApprenticeNBC contestants on his show.
We love his support & he’s a terrific host.
Tonight: Omarosa.
It was my great honor to defend @dennisrodman on @ApprenticeNBC last night—he has come a long way and for the good!
In standing by @dennisrodman I was  also representing many people who have addiction problems & are working hard to come back.....
than his destruction of Scotland’s magnificent lands..
@AlexSalmond’s insane release of the terrorist—for humanitarian reasons--will go down as a better decision..
Today The Blue Monster is torn up.
The Trump National @DoralResort is being revolutionized with $200M of renovations.
Immigration reform is all risk for the @GOP.
Their base doesn’t want it and the 12M illegals will all vote Democrat.
The only place where our "border" is protected is from Europeans.
We educate them in our finest institutions & then have them deported..
Sacrificing our nation’s bravest for  ungrateful Iraqis = great for China.
Are you expanding your business?
Interview returning soldiers.
Give them strong consideration.
Their sacrifices deserve it.
A-Rod’s salary is more than the entire @astros.
Half the players on @astros will have better seasons than him.
A-Rod is a joke!
The @Yankees should immediately stop paying A-Rod—he signed his contract without telling them he was a druggie...
"....
among ABC, CBS and NBC in the key news demo of adults....
In the 10:30 PM ET lead-in to local news, @ApprenticeNBC delivered a 31 percent margin of victory...
Set the bar high, do the best you possibly can, and believe in yourself—because if you don’t, no one else will either.
Be passionate.
If you love what you're doing, success will follow.
Bob & Suzanne Wright, co-founders of @autismspeaks  have done an absolutely fantastic job—two real winners.
With Dr. Dror Paley & Dr. Ben Carson with two wonderful children at Mar-a-Lago.
With the impending crisis in Korea, is it a big confidence builder that Chuck Hagel is Sec.
of Defense?
Elections have consequences.
China has control over North Korea!
The Yuan hit another record high against the Dollar.
China is laughing at our expense.
I look forward to Saturday night and being inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame..
@BillMoyers is a liberal hack whose career is being laid to rest @PBS.
In this time of economic turmoil where millions of Americans are unemployed, our tax dollars are paying @BillMoyers' big @PBS salary!
I think it was terrible that Tim Cook of Apple apologized to China.
What the hell is he apologizing for?
Steve Jobs wouldn’t.
I ask again, how much is very wealthy South Korea paying the United States for protecting it against North Korea?
Another freezing day in the Spring - what is going on with "global warming"?
Good move changing the name to "climate change" - sad!
The basketball coach at Rutgers looks bad but I had a coach who made him look like a baby - coaches can be tough!
I played football and baseball, sorry, but said to be the best bball player in N.Y. State-ask coach Ted Dobias-said best he ever coached.
We should look to China where big time pollution takes place as they manufacture inefficient and costly wind turbines for Scotland!
The purpose of China’s massive military buildup on the Nork’s border is to intimidate us.
China attacked us during the Korean War.
Now AP is banning the term "illegal immigrants" What should we call them?
'Americans'?!
This country's political press is amazing!
Look for good ideas outside of your own areas of expertise.
Find innovations, approaches, and practices that you could adapt in your field.
Re: Negotiation: View any conflict as an opportunity.
Be a diplomat as much as possible.
Negotiation: Think about what the other side wants.
Know where they’re coming from.
Don't underestimate them.
Create a win/win situation.
Remember, Celebrity Apprentice  tonight  on CNBC at 9.
Amazing episode - watch Omarosa get the boot!
Looking forward to @VinceMcMahon inducting me into @WWE Hall of Fame this Saturday in @TheGarden..
@WineEnthusiast just awarded Trump Vineyard’s Sparkling Reserve 91 points --- the highest rated wine in Virginia...
Your work will never be in vain if you work for a cause that is greater than yourself.
I have gotten to know many Spanish speaking people as the owner of Trump National  Doral in Miami.
North Korea can't survive, or even eat, without the help of China.
China could solve this problem with one phone call-they love taunting us!
Word is spreading that I got a tattoo - no way, I am not a fan!
Jobs report is really bad - beyond the worst projections.
A bad day on Wall Street!
Very exciting—tomorrow night at Madison Square Garden I get inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame.
Tell me, which is “cooler”—my induction into the @WWE Hall of Fame or my Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?
James Holmes, the Aurora, Colorado guy who killed 12 people & injured 58 others, is fighting hard to avoid the death penalty Who says the death penalty is not a deterrent?
Only 88,000 jobs were added this past March.
Prediction was 190,000.
Businesses can’t expand with Obama Care & high taxes on horizon.
This Sunday’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC has the most beautiful boardroom judges ever w/ @IvankaTrump & @MELANIATRUMP together!
Sunday night at 9 PM EST will be re-run of last week's episode of Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC, followed by new episode at 10 PM.
I will be On The Record with Greta Van Susteren @gretawire tonight at 10 PM on Fox News.
Spent full day with contractors at Trump National Doral - it will be amazing!
I am doing On the Record With Greta Van Susteren at 10 P.M. on Fox.
We will be talking about the bad economy and other subjects of interest!
I'm getting ready to be inducted tonight into the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden - a great honor for me and the Trump family!
Our President must be very careful with the 28 year old wack job in North Korea.
When is South Korea going to start paying us for the massive amounts of money we are spending to protect them from the North?
China is pushing North Korea!
True, America is rapidly losing it's SPIRIT, and when that's gone, we will only be going in one direction - and that direction is down!
My induction last night at Madison Square Garden into the WWE Hall of Fame was amazing-I met some great people, including Bruno.
Celebrity Apprentice is rebroadcasting last weeks episode at 9 P.M. WITH A GREAT NEW EPISODE FEATURING @MELANIA TRUMP AT 10 P.M. - AMAZING!
Dennis Rodman is a project manager tonight on Celebrity Apprentice - watch Dennis in full action!
I’m at @WrestleMania tonight but will be doing a few tweets.
I know the episode well.....
@pennjillette and @dennisrodman as PM’s- I’m proud of Dennis and his performance this season.
It appears that @THEGaryBusey is entranced with @MELANIATRUMP- and rightly so!
What do you think so far?
The boardroom and @WrestleMania- I'm watching great entertainment tonight!
I’m a star maker- Adrian has continued to receive many fans in @TrumpTowerNY and @AmandaTMiller is definitely on the map!
@MELANIATRUMP just finished being on @theviewtv--by any standard, she was great!
Thanks @WWE--@VinceMcMahon is an amazing guy.
I am very impressed by @dennisrodman.
His return to this season’s @ApprenticeNBC  showed who Dennis really is--which is very good.
Margaret Thatcher was the Iron Lady of the West.
She promoted freedom & democracy---a great leader & ally of America.
The new reality.
‘China Daily’ is sold in street newspaper vending machines across DC.
Why not?
They own the place.
Think positively.
There are always opportunities.
Keep your focus and don't give up!
Don't negate your own power.
Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it.
Fear is the opposite of faith.
I just left @trumpwinery in Charlottesville,Virginia --- it is the finest in the country--- really incredible!
It’s Tuesday, how much has China stolen from us today through cyber espionage?
Yea, NBC has increased all remaining Celebrity Apprentice episodes to two hours starting at 9 P.M. on Sunday!
Amazing show..
@JerryLawler was terrific.
Watching the show.
Vince McMahon shows the crowd one of the greatest moments in WWE History.
Making my speech.
Another one of me on stage.
Family group shot.
Watching @trishstratuscom get inducted from the sold out crowd.
Fellow inductee @SammartinoBruno and me.
What a great group!
Class of 2013.
With fellow inductees in front of the sold out crowd at MSG.
Why did Vince and the WWE give my speech and segment the most time last night on USA Network - because that's what people want to see!
Sorry losers and haters, but I LOVED the great energy in Madison Square Garden during my speech.
The WWE thought it was incredible - it was!
I hope everyone (especially the haters and losers) goes to Macy's today and buys some DJT ties, shirts and suits-and SUCCESS Fragrance-love!
The $200M renovations at Trump @DoralResort are right on target.
When completed, the course will be as good as it gets.
Sexual pervert Anthony Weiner has zero business holding public office..
@Yankees Kevin Youkilis is off to a terrific start.
He’s less than half the price and a much better player than a drug free A-Rod.
I feel so badly for Mark Cuban-the Dallas Mavericks were just eliminated from the playoffs and his partners are pissed.
Very sad!
@alexsalmond @pressjournal  RT @rdowns @realdonaldtrump Margaret Thatcher NEVER would have allowed those wind mill monstrosities.
Opportunities only present themselves if you are out there looking for them.
Be aggressive and seize them when they come.
Congratulations to @IvankaTrump and Jared on the big news.
I will have yet another grandchild this fall!
Congratulations to @nyknicks on winning their first Atlantic Division title since 1994.
@carmeloanthony is a great New Yorker and Knick!
I really liked everyone at the @WWE Hall of Fame ceremony--fantastic people!
@Jimmyv3  @WWE Greatly appreciate your nice words re WrestleMania.
That’s why you are such a respected writer.
The time has come.
THEGaryBusey will be project mgr on this Sunday's All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC.
MUST SEE TV!!!
Back to 2 hrs.
Mr. President, it is time to lead on the Korean crisis.
Make a statement from the Rose Garden and send a strong message to the man child!
I can't believe we are not asking South Korea for anything.
They make a fortune on us while we spend a fortune defending them-how stupid!
Don't talk to me about Bush, I was never a defender or a fan!
@alexsalmond RT @King_Pepp  Driving through Indiana and seeing tons of ugly windmills.
All eyes are on @TigerWoods @The_Masters.
He’s in good position!
@TrumpWaikiki is Hawaii’s top luxury hotel & destination..
@alexsalmond @pressjournal @BBCNews RT @DanScavino - one would think the photo & caption - says it all.....
China controls North Korea.
So now besides cyber hacking us all day, they are using the Norks to taunt us.
China is a major threat.
The only American who has met with the North Korean man child is Dennis Rodman.
Isn’t that frightening and sad?
Where is the President?
It is time for him to come on TV and show strength against the repeated threats from North Korea -- and others.
Always remember that as your success grows, you will be asked for more favors.
Learn how to say ‘No.
’ It is critical.
My performance from last week on David Letterman @Late_Show will be re-aired tonight at 11:35 PM on CBS.
Remember to take time this weekend to relax and regroup.
It will pay major dividends for the next week.
Our country should be worried about nuclear control far more than gun control--& that one's not even close!
I am on David Letterman tonight.
What a shame that Kobe Bryant was so badly injured last night - a truly great champion who brought the Lakers back from oblivion this year!
Bad break for @TigerWoods-hits a great shot which hits the pin and kicks into the water-gets a bogey on hole with another great shot-Champ!
Did A Rod really try to buy the papers that would implicate him re.
drugs - wow, that would be the end, a disaster!
China will extract much from Secretary Kerry and the U:S.
in order for them to help us with the North Korea problem-don't let this happen!
South Korea must in some form pay for our help-the U.S. must stop being stupid!
Make sure to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at  9 on NBC.
A GREAT SHOW, JUST LIKE THE MASTERS.
Great job @AdamScott - you deserve it!
Get ready to turn to NBC for CELEBRITY APPRENTICE -- TONIGHT'S SHOW IS GREAT!
A lot of comments re @MELANIATRUMP vs.
Milania last week.
I think spelling has taken on a new significance.
It’s true—@dennisrodman gets the comeback of the year award.
I didn’t like having to fire him..
@THEGaryBusey as Project Manager...
is Team Power in trouble??
What would you choose- Vampires or Cavemen?
@pennjillette doesn’t like @StephenBaldwin7’s cliché line and Stephen says Penn creeps him out.
Do we sense conflict yet?
Based on the shoots- which silent film do you think will be better?
@PennJillette and @StephenBaldwin7's arguments are making the edit room look like the boardroom.
It's boardroom time!
Does anyone miss @OMAROSA?
What is your favorite @THEGaryBusey film?
Tonight's short film?
Point Break?
Lethal Weapon?
Do you know how many years @TheRealMarilu starred on Taxi?
I’m impressed -- both teams have produced very entertaining silent films.
Product integration is very important.
Who do you think is going home?
Do you think I made the right decision?
Will be doing Fox and Friends in two minutes!
@DonaldJTrumpJr  and @EricTrump with @HulkHogan  -- Great shot!
@TheRealMarilu is impressing the All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC viewers with her continued success on Team Power.
My heart goes out to the people of Boston on this terrible day!
We must change the laws of our land and seek fair but rapid trials for the perpetrators of terrorist acts (Boston) with harsh punishment!
@hardball_chris must have the lowest IQ on television—now telling people that domestic terrorists are from the right..
@hardball_chris  Did you forget about Bill Ayers & so many others?
You should apologize to all the people you offended yesterday.
I’ve known @hardball_chris for a long time & sadly, he gets dumber each & every year--& started from a very low base.
It’s very sad that the administration isn’t sending anyone to Margaret Thatcher’s funeral.
She was a big U.S. supporter.
Throwing out the first pitch a few years ago at Fenway in Boston- Boston will be better than ever.
The world economy is under deep stress with growth slowing everywhere.
Yet crude is over $87/barrel.
Should be $25 at the most..
@alexsalmond  RT @islandbluenose  You'll be doing us in scotland a great service if you win.
Good Luck...
Negotiation is persuasion more than power.
Be reasonable and flexible, and never let anyone know exactly where you’re coming from.
I sure hope the sexting pervert Anthony Weiner runs for mayor.
Will be great fun watching him both lose and be humiliated.
With @StephenBaldwin7 earlier today at @ApprenticeNBC press conference in @TrumpTowerNY.
I discuss yesterday's tragedy at the Boston Marathon in today's video blog.
Great to see @RedSox win big yesterday.
Good for Boston and the country.
Yesterday we were all @RedSox fans.
Had a fantastic time at yesterday’s All-Star @ApprenticeNBC press conference with @StephenBaldwin7 in @TrumpTowerNY.
The Chinese must still be laughing at Kerry’s trip to China.
He got nothing, gave them everything and promised even more.
Business is easy.
Dealing with people is hard.
If you are an entrepreneur, your most important job is to choose who works with you.
It is terrible that neither Obama, Biden nor Kerry attended Lady Thatcher’s funeral.
They would all run to Muslim Brotherhood Morsi’s.
Druggie A-Rod, @MLB’s biggest fraud, is lucky George Steinbrenner is no longer with us.
@Yankees would have voided his contract.
Thinking small when you could think big limits you in all aspects of your life.
Everyone loves @AmandaTMiller- here she is with @Joan_Rivers and me.
The reality is that no gun bill will ever stop tragedies.
And as we have learned from ObamaCare, Washington only makes things worse!
Amazing!
Pervert alert!
Sexter Anthony Weiner will be running for Mayor of New York City.
Being tough doesn’t mean being nasty, difficult, or unreasonable.
It means being tenacious and refusing to give in or give up.
With @IvankaTrump and crew at the start of a new @DoralResort.
Another great shot from the beginning of construction at @DoralResort.
South African Tourism North America will unveil its new ad campaign “What’s Your BIG 5?
” on All-Star @ApprenticeNBC this Sunday.
These Tsarnaev brothers did not work alone.
They had help and assistance from other cell members.
Be vigilant and on the lookout.
The @FBIPressOffice, police & others are doing an amazing job.
How genius was it putting together that tape?
Lots of comments—Do you really believe these two brothers operated alone without influence of others?
David Pecker would be a brilliant choice as CEO of TIME Magazine -- nobody could bring it back like David!
@CNN should stop apologizing for the mistake they made the other day & get back to reporting!
Get ALL the info,  then quick trial, then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people!
Do not be kind.
You must be kidding-zero chance he is innocent!
Read my tweets you dopes-of course he should get a trial-but fast (not a 12 year disaster).
Is the Boston killer eligible for Obama Care to bring him back to health?
Great job by the FBI, Boston Police and all others involved-start the trial tonight!
Sorry,  the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost.
Also, fragrance is amazing.
GO TO MACY'S.
Oh no, they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument.
I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
I hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as "the suspect".
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?
You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!
Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life, Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9.
It will be a full two hour show!
Watch Gary B tonight on Celebrity Apprentice-some really crazy things happen!
Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.
Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse!
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA.
He was in perfect shape!
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...
you will love it!
Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better.
Once he is well he will say, "speak to my lawyers".
What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well?
I suspect he may talk!
Seems like the teams are surprised when @THEGaryBusey comes back..
@TraceAdkins presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a $40,000 check for Sandy Relief.
You can tell he’s very pleased about that--& rightly so..
@bretmichaels and George Ross are back as advisors.
Good to see them!
Everybody loves @bretmichaels!
He’s a great champion and this is where he should be.
He agrees!
I hope you are watching the Apprentice...
tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back!
How stressed are @lisarinna and @pennjillette already?
@THEGaryBusey is making no attempt to help.
Is he in BuseyLand?
@TraceAdkins isn’t excited about their ideas.
Are you?
George Ross could be right—@THEGaryBusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task.
This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of @lisarinna and @pennjillette.
This assignment has been a challenge to both teams.
For you newcomers, George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice.
Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer?
Looking forward to @THEGaryBusey's book of "Buseyisms"!
George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together.
He’s a tough negotiator.
George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004.
A great time!
What did you think of the boardroom?
My ties and shirts are doing very big numbers @Macy's, beyond my wildest thoughts!
Thanks @GoAngelo and the rest of the losers for mentions!
Will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 A.M. (in 20 minutes).
Me, by a lot!
Spent the weekend in LA checking out Trump National Golf Club on the Pacific Ocean.
An amazing place!
@MacMiller has over 79M hits on YouTube & just hit platinum with his Donald Trump song—screw you Mac!
The big problem for little @MacMiller is that he’s going to have to have another hit song, not just his Donald Trump bonanza..
@foxandfriends int.
The Boston killer will soon be asking for a Presidential pardon—don’t give it to him, Mr. President—hang tough!
@BrandenRoderick did a great job on All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC.
Raised a lot of money for charity while looking great.
In light of Boston, immigration legislation will be much harder to get..
@THEGaryBusey survives another week of All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC.
Gary is shifty and playing to win.
Will Barack Obama personally read the Boston terrorist his Miranda Rights?
Next time you are waiting in an emergency room remember the Boston killer was rushed to intensive care within minutes of capture.
If your enemies end up liking you it’s because they beat you.
You want their respect, not their friendship.
In three years people won’t be building wind turbines anymore - they are obsolete & totally destroy the environment in which they sit.
It’s freezing in New York—where the hell is global warming?
I’ve always been a fan of Steve Jobs, especially after watching Apple stock collapse w/out him – but the yacht he built is truly ugly.
This past Sunday’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC continued to win the key demographic of adults 25-54.
An amazing run!
@AlexSalmond, don’t worry, my ad will be shown across the world--and it is highly accurate!
The dying @VanityFair’s circulation has “dropped” & its newsstand sales have “plummeted by 20.
Did the Boston terrorists register their guns?
No.
Another example of why gun control legislation is not the answer!
Sexting Pervert @anthonyweiner has returned to twitter.
Parents of all underage girls should BLOCK him immediately!
Will @anthonyweiner be fully clothed in his mayoral ads?
It was great to have @ApprenticeNBC veterans George Ross and @BretMichaels back in the boardroom.
Wrong, used to be called global warming and when that name didn't work, they deftly changed it to climate change-because it's freezing!
The Chinese talk of climate change and carbon footprint but don't clean up their factories-but they sell us the equipment to clean up ours!
The Central Park Five documentary  was a one sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the.
I have many great people but also an amazing number of haters and losers responding to my tweets-why do these lowlifes follow-nothing to do!
Scotland does not have free press, even when you are just stating the facts-it's crazy!
Lance Armstrong just got sued by the Federal Government-they want their money back-I told you so!
What was he thinking when he did that int?
The mother of the Boston killers (not suspects) says her boys are totally innocent and were set up-I can see the 14 year long defense now!
I promise you that I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz - I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow.
Who, by the way, is totally overrated.
As everybody knows, but the haters & losers refuse to acknowledge, I do not wear a “wig”.
My hair may not be perfect but it’s mine.
The Boston killer applying today for ObamaCare.
He demands that medical bills be taken care of immediately.
Does this include dental?
Sen.
@MaxBaucus has announced his retirement.
A major proponent of ObamaCare, Baucus now says it’s a ‘huge train wreck.
Can someone explain to me how a Chechnyan permanent resident non-citizen in our country is planning Jihad while on welfare?
Watch out.
Champion @Joan_Rivers returns to the Boardroom as a judge in this week’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC.
Don't cross her!
Do executives at @msnbc know that the business of TV centers on viewers & ratings?
By rejecting my ad on ugly windmills & @AlexSalmond’s faulty thinking on the “Lockerbie bomber” the ad is now on worldwide newscasts.
The entire village of Blackdog in Scotland protested to the Council last night about the ugly windmills.
The Council was shocked by the exuberance of the demonstration in Blackdog.
The Council is concerned over the health & safety for the village of Blackdog w/ placement of sub-station.
The sub-station in Blackdog is very dangerous on unregulated landfill—fire hazard!
@VattenfallGroup  had no answers at demonstration last night.
It’s a failing company.
Aberdeen windmills will destroy it..
@VattenfallGroup doesn’t have the finances or financial statement to build the hated windfarm in Aberdeen.
Former Weather Underground radical Kathy Boudin spent 22 yrs in prison for armored-car robbery that killed 2 cops & a Brinks guard.....
and now holds an adjunct professorship at Columbia University.
Boudin also received an academic laurel from NYU Law School What is wrong with this story?
Isn’t this just ridiculous?
Terrible!
Wow, I’m at 2,200,000  followers but I’d love to get rid of the haters & losers—they’re such a waste of time!
Weiner says many more pictures may be out there—this is just what NYC needs, a pervert Mayor.
Pervert Alert!
Serial sexter @anthonyweiner has promised to use twitter as a “tool”.
Parents,make sure your children have him blocked.
After tearing W Bush down for 12 years, now the media loves him.
Why not?
He gave them Obama.
Dangerous..
We need another Bush in office about as much as we need Obama to have a 3rd term.
No more Bushes!
House Republicans should be doing everything possible to defund ObamaCare.
Do as I say, not as I do.
To be in charge, you have to take responsibility, you have to instill confidence.
It’s like being a conductor--set the tempo.
Can @pennjillette @lisarinna and @THEGaryBusey continue to co-exist?
Find out on this Sunday’s Celebrity All-Star @ApprenticeNBC.
Study your area of business.
All business involves risk, but risk can be reduced when you learn everything you can about what you’re doing.
The Boston terrorist thugs’ mother is also a radical.
I am sure she will be granted citizenship shortly.
Does Bush’s library have a wing featuring Supreme Court Justice Jon Robert’s ObamaCare ruling?
Roberts was his prize appointee!
Get ready for fireworks…@Joan_Rivers & @THEGaryBusey face off in the Board Room this Sunday on All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC.
Often times being ‘innovative’ is simply putting together pre-existing elements into something new.
Be resourceful & expect success.
This Sunday’s All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC features the return of @Joan_Rivers.
Sunday at 9 PM on @NBC--full 2 hours.
Ignorance is inexcusable; it’s the surest way to fail.
No acceptable reason exists for not being well informed.
What apology, didn't they go around beating the crap out of people and robbing them?
Why did they all confess?
Aren't police convinced?
The Time Magazine list of the 100 Most Influential People is a joke and stunt of a magazine that will, like Newsweek,soon be dead.
Bad list!
Thanks for the tremendous support for my shirts, ties and suits at Macy's.
They do great because of really high quality at a low price.
Marble mouth @tombrokaw asks "why do we think to have a successful eveving you have to have Donald Trump as your guest of honor"?
We have the Final Six—and @LilJon is the last remaining member of Team Power.
He’s done a great job.
Here’s @Joan_Rivers.
She & @IvankaTrump make a terrific team as my advisors.
Do you think @THEGaryBusey will be able to “step up” as PM?
I know @lisarinna is hoping so..
@THEGaryBusey doesn’t need instructions.
Couch time is more fun.
Looks like Plan B is stuck with the mechanical dog.
@THEGaryBusey has latched on and won’t let go..
@THEGaryBusey feels he’s been abandoned by his team.
Do you think so?
@TraceAdkins says @Joan_Rivers is a gem.
I agree.
We all agree..
@IvankaTrump is right—Plan B has descended into a state of total chaos.
Team Power+@LilJon= Spielberg?
Let’s find out.
What did you think of @THEGaryBusey's mechanical dog idea?
Boardroom time- which team do you think had the best presentation?
Great memory @TheRealMarilu!
Maybe @THEGaryBusey should stick to words...
vs.
barking.
He’s got a definite talent when he wants to use it.
Do you agree with the client's decision?
Great boardroom.
Mechanical dog is going to be trending tonight.
Did you agree with my decision?
Doing Fox and Friends at 7.00 A.M.  Hope you loved Apprentice last night.
Just out- @ApprenticeNBC was in first place in all demos during the 10PM hour in the ratings.
I have a lot of @Apple stock--- and I miss Steve Jobs.
Tim Cook must immediately increase the size of the screen...
The  White House Correspondents' dinner was so boring this year- I guess that’s because I didn’t attend(even...
Next year @TomBrokaw should be the comedian at the White House Correspondents’ dinner.
The only problem is that....
@DannyZuker I hear your filmography is "stacked" with failures.....
but you only want to talk about 10 years later when I still win 10PM in all key demos..
@richardroeper- Perhaps one of the worst replacements in showbiz, once you went on it was over!
Your taste sucks!
@DannyZuker I'm in front of the camera and behind the camera- just looked at your picture, you'll never be in front of the camera!
I just sent @THEGaryBusey a check of $20,000 for his charity, Children's Kawasaki Disease .
He worked hard and deserves it.
By Scotland officials canceling my local ad about how damaging wind turbines are- it became a much bigger story around the world.
Great!
Afghan Leader Karzai has received tens of millions of dollars IN CASH from the U.S. Government- how stupidly is our Country being run?
Photo from a recent episode of @ApprenticeNBC - saying those two famous words!
@Lawrence is the poor man's left wing @oreillyfactor(with no ratings)!
Congratulations to Michael Jordan on his marriage over the weekend.
Just left news conference at @TrumpTowerNY with @TheGaryBusey- people love @TheGaryBusey!
Once again @LilJon has competed at a very high level on Celebrity All Star @ApprenticeNBC.
He is a great competitor.
Housing prices are up in Feb over last Feb 9.
Money is really cheap so this is a great time to buy a house-but be sure to lock in long term financing (without which don't buy).
Snow and freezing weather all over mid-section of Country.
Global warming specialists better start thinking fast!
I disagree, but it's still cool.
The people of Scotland are really starting to fight the ugly industrial wind turbines.
Upstate New York is suffering with record unemployment.
Fracking is the answer.
Frack now and Frack fast!
ObamaCare is a disaster.
Americans will see record increases in their premiums and inferior care services.
Oil should not cost more than $40 a barrel.
Ideally it should be $25.
Cheap to produce and we protect the OPEC countries.
Just took a look at Time Magazine-looks really flimsy like a free handout at a parking lot!
The sad end is coming-just like Newsweek!
Jodi should try but the Govt.
Jodi, if you're listening, MAKE A DEAL!
All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC is down to the five final contestants.
Getting fired now is when it really hurts!
@chrislhayes replaced @edshow on @msnbc to increase ratings.
It’s a shame Chris’ are even worse.
Sad to see.
With Boston terrorist cell widening in suspects, it's now clear that it was a mistake to read the bomber the Miranda warning so early.
My wife, Melania, will be on @QVC today @ 5 PM selling really beautiful jewelry at a very low price.
Perfect for Mother’s Day—call in!
Call @MELANIATRUMP today on @QVC  at 5 PM EST, say hello, and buy buy buy!
Our trade deficit is still on pace to be over $500B.
This is killing our manufacturing sector and sending jobs overseas.
Why are some more concerned with granting terrorist rights than protecting innocent Americans?
Turn to QVC now to watch Melania - really good stuff!
It's crunch time.
This Sunday's All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC's task will separate the winners from the losers.
Amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” like they are so original & like no one else is doing it...
What’s funny about the name “F**kface Von Clownstick” -- it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter.
If Jon Stewart is so above it all & legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz?
He should be proud of his heritage!
Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is a total phony –he should cherish his past—not run from it.
As I’ve said many times before, Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow is highly overrated.
Time magazine should name David Pecker of American Media to be its top guy...
but they are not smart enough to do that!
When written in Chinese, the word 'crisis' is composed of two characters.
One represents danger and the other represents opportunity".
Enjoy Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 - a really great episode!
@TheRealMarilu was very impressive and is a great person.
The All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC viewers loved her.
The Trump Organization is honored to be expanding our interests into Dubai.
The golf course will be the top course in the Middle East..
@lisarinna is the last lady standing in All Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC.
Watch out men, she’s sharp and tough.
Benghazi was a massive cover up..
Head of Air Force's anti-sexual assault unit arrested for sexual assault!
It just seems that our Country is not what it used to be.
Sexual assault and rape in the Armed Forces is a Massive problem that nobody wants to talk about or do anything about-the big dark secret!
Keep Wednesday morning free.
You will want to see this!
Tired of being bullied by the economy?
I'm going to help people.
The economy is broken.
Entrepreneurship is being suppressed.
See what I do Wednesday 11 AM at Trump Tower atrium.
My @foxandfriends int.
Trump @DoralResort’s renovations are on schedule.
With such a massive project underway, I am watching closely.
My @gretawire int.
Everyone join me tomorrow at 11 AM in Trump Tower atrium.
What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?
The Generals and top military brass never wanted a mixer but were forced to do it by very dumb politicians who wanted to be politically C!
The jury in the Jodi Arias trial is, believe it or not, still out.
Is it even slightly possible that Jodi Arias could be set free-wow, what a miscarriage of justice that would be!
Wow, I love stimulating debate and driving certain people crazy-the Generals were forced to do something they didn't want to do (not me).
Just watched Jon Stewart(?
) jumping up and down and screaming like a madman - nothing funny or smart, just loud and obnoxious, a pushy dope!
I would absolutely kill Jon Stewart(?
) in a debate - it would be no contest - he's not fast enough or smart enough (only obnoxious enough!
).
I'm giving away money!
Be there or be left behind!
Residential Capital, a company in which Warren Buffett is involved, went bankrupt - but that doesn't mean that Warren Buffett went bankrupt!
People do not assume this but more than anything else, I like helping people.
Be at Trump Tower at 11 AM today.
It's go time!
See you at Trump Tower.
I'm giving money away!
I gave away money.
I just gave lots of money away at Trump Tower to people who needed it...
they were very happy and appreciative!
Scary.
We continue to lose our nation’s finest in Afghanistan almost daily.
The Rules of Engagement are costing lives.
What do you think about the push to put women into high intensity combat situations?
Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it!
Man, we had a great day today at Trump Tower - lots of money was given to many people who really needed it - good feelings and happiness!
Jodi thought she outsmarted the system - it didn't work!
Congratulations to the jury on a job well done!
Now, will it be life or death?
A Warren Buffett corp.
is currently ensnared in a bankruptcy.
Likewise Icahn, Kravis, Apollo and many others have played the game.
Thanks!
Sadly, firing can be an essential and responsible business decision.
It isn't pleasant, but lopping off a branch can save a tree.
I watched @todayshow this AM re: @MarthaStewart & dating.
She looks terrific, better than ever, any guy would be lucky to be with her..
@limbaugh is right.
Watergate is much different than Benghazi.
No one died in Watergate.
Dummy, I'm asking a question - look at the question mark at the end of the sentence!
Use your head.
Whether you have someone managing your finances or you're doing it yourself, money, like anything, takes maintenance & planning to grow.
No investor would be stupid enough to pour their money into the bottomless Vattenfall pit.
Leightweight @Lord Sugar virtually begged my reps to have me stop mocking him.
Just left Trump National Doral in Miami - under massive construction - The Blue Monster will be one of the greatest courses ever built!
The success of Shark Tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of The Apprentice, one of the biggest hits in T.V. history.
Watching @TigerWoods on NBC playing great golf.
Tiger won The WGC Cadillac Championship at Trump National Doral this year.
I love Tiger!
Two people fired very early on Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9 leading up to next weeks live Finale.
Don't get angry at me tonight!
You will love Celebrity Apprentice tonight - 9 PM on NBC.
Must watch from beginning - two early firings!
I AM PLEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT CELEBRITY APPRENTICE HAS BEEN RENEWED FOR ANOTHER SEASON BY NBC.
SEE YOU AT THE NBC UPFRONTS TOMORROW.
My @foxandfriends int.
on IRS targeting Tea Party, the Benghazi death scandal & @TraceAdkins v...
@LilJon once again made it to the Final Four.
Benghazi.
Obama lied.
Our people died.
Where the hell is global warming when you need it?
@TrumpNationalNY is NY's best golf club.
This Sunday’s LIVE FINALE of @ApprenticeNBC puts @pennjillette against @TraceAdkins.
Watch two great competitors battle to win!
Not since Watergate have we been going thru a time like this--Benghazi, IRS, wiretapping of @AP...
I totally respect that Angelina Jolie has shown such great bravery in the face of danger - she has really come a long and positive way!
The "lady" in Chicago that I'm fighting owes me $500, 000 and is sophisticated  & vicious.
She made up a story & plays the "age card" - bad!
The three political disasters could lead to a major and complete political meltdown!
I wonder what the next scandal will be in D.C.?
Can we handle yet another?
If these scandals happened before the election, Obama could not have won.
Obama & his people did a brilliant job of delaying these scandals until after the election.
Mitt must be going wild thinking about it!
Legendary Illusionist v.
Country Music Star.
This Sunday’s LIVE Finale of @ApprenticeNBC is a historic matchup.
MUST SEE TV!
ObamaCare is already done.
HHS Sec..
Looks like we will have a pervert running for mayor after all - just what New York City needs - and he will revert back to form, always do!
America's top Army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.
Forces greatly hurt!
Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.
What is going on?
General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control.
Many generals and military leaders are now saying "I told you so"!
They say this will have big impact on military strength & national sec.
Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so "politically correct" or we won't have a Country to run anymore!
I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS, including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there, kept the oil!
In other words, our military has a very big problem!
Celebrity Apprentice will be LIVE on Sunday at 9 PM (from New York City).
Casting has already begun for next season..
@NYMag is a piece of garbage but I think it is very nice & charitable that they employ the no-talent illiterate hack @jonathanchait.
Just in—all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failed—in fact, the stoppers have become the abusers.
The sexual abuse that is so rampant has, according to generals, greatly weakened our military.
They have failed to stop it.
People love @LilJon!
This Sunday’s LIVE FINALE of @ApprenticeNBC will be tough & nasty.
Be sure to watch @pennjillette & @TraceAdkins fight to the finish!
Enviro friendly?
The LIVE FINALE of @ApprenticeNBC is this Sunday at 9/8C.
Watch and see who will be the first ever All-Star Celebrity Apprentice.
Who do you like of the final two?
Why didn't President Obama just go inside when it started raining yesterday - common sense!
The two Marines looked very uncomfortable-& wet.
I'm watching Knicks game-I'd bet all of those guys with the terrible tattoos wish they never got them-too bad, too late!
Sugar is nowhere near being a billionaire-and I know, he works for me!
How badly will the Country be hurt by the three scandals and the very poor implementation and cost of Obama Care?
The cast for next season looks really good!
Ivanka and Joan Rivers will be working hard tonight at the Live Finale - everybody must watch the OPENING at 9.
Last night's live show was so much fun.
Congrats to the entire cast, they are all winners!
From beginning over $13 million for charity.
I love that, in addition to everything else, so much money is raised for such great causes on Celebrity Apprentice-all proud of that!
Will be doing Fox & Friends at 7 A.M.
It never ends (hopefully)!
@MELANIATRUMP, @IvankaTrump, @EricTrump, @DonaldJTrumpJr & I  thank our loyal fans for another great season of @ApprenticeNBC!
Everyone should go see @HatingBreitbart.
Great documentary showcasing @AndrewBreitbart’s legacy.
Excited to speak at tomorrow night's @ocrp Lincoln Day dinner in Michigan  “All time sales record, over 2000”.
Because of the tornado tragedy I will not be doing @piersmorgan tonight.
I wish everyone well!
Good timing: @TraceAdkins won big for American Red Cross last night on @ApprenticeNBC.
Now the Red Cross is in Oklahoma doing a great job.
Isn’t it amazing that Obama “never knew” about the IRS scandals until he saw it in the news?!
Very sad that Republican donors were targeted by Obama’s IRS.
One season ends and another starts.
Already casting for the next @ApprenticeNBC.
Great news for charity--$13 million so far.
The Lincoln Day Dinner last night in Michigan was fantastic.
Record attendance and tremendous enthusiasm- I loved it!
Circulation is way down and all he thinks about are his bad food restaurants.
I can't believe @VanityFair would renew Graydon Carter's contract......
Graydon Carter is laughing at the stupidity of Chuck Townsend on his contract renewal--- even he doesn't believe it!
Amazingly @AnthonyWeiner is going to run.
The cure rate for his problem is 0.
Lots of other things will come out.
Jodi Arias jury is having a hard time with the death penalty-judge just sent them back for further deliberatuon..
@Newsmax__Media is one of the top media outlets in the country.
@ChrisRuddyNMX has revolutionized political commentary and reporting.
If the great Si Newhouse were still running @CondeNastCorp, he would fire Graydon Carter immediately- circulation tanking..
@VanityFair could come back if Graydon Carter paid as much attention as he does to his bad food restaurants.
Pervert Anthony Wiener will never be able to get away from his perversion-the cure rate is ZERO.
I very much appreciate all of the great reviews & comments on my speech in Michigan--the people were great.
It's important to remain open to new ideas and new information.
Keep your door open every day to something innovative and energizing.
The so called 87 year old "lady" was a vicious and skilled investor who was trying to rip me off with made up facts and a blowhard lawyer.
Jury was unanimous after hearing the made up case against my co.
Filed many years ago, she.
I loved beating these two terrible human beings.
I would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer, he is a total loser!
Thank you for all of the positive response on my Chicago lawsuit victory yesterday.
Most of you saw through the phony age card ploy.
Mrs. Goldberg, who filed the Chicago case many years ago, is a vicious and conniving woman--loved beating her.
Memorial Day is a time to honor our nation's finest who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.
God bless them all.
Looking forward to being guest of honor at @ralphreed's @FFCoalition Patriot Gala Dinner on June 14th in DC.
Flag day and my birthday.
In your planning, know how much risk you can take.
Evaluate whether the returns will be worth the risk.
The biggest business people have used the bankruptcy laws to their advantage-Warren B, Icahn, Kravis and this week John Paulson-for haters!
Great investor John Paulson just sought bankruptcy protection for a unit of his hedge fund-very smart-but he didn't go bankrupt you morons!
It should be mandatory that all haters and losers use their real name or identification when tweeting - they will no longer be so brave!
I was just told by a television pro thay @DannyZucker is one of the truly dumbest guys in the business-he's obsessed with T-so many flops!
I never heard of @DannyZucker until his very dumb and endless tweets started pouring out of insecure mind-but I have a great deal for him!
Just got final renderings of Trump National Doral in Miami - there will be nothing like it in the Country, will be the best!
Remember, @dannyzuker , you are not even the real "boss" of Modern Family - no big $$$$$$'s for you!
No @DannyZuker , just the opposite, lots of money can go to charity if you have the guts to play the game (deal)!
No @DannyZuker it's making you crazy because you don't have the guts to play the game.
Come on Danny, you can do it!
Hope everyone is watching the Finale rerun of Celebrity Apprentice on CNBC-especially the haters and losers!
It is on right now.
The lawyer I just beat in Chicago was a buffoon but was a lot smarter and sharper than @DannyZuker.
Come on Danny, make the bet!
If @DannyZuker competed against me and.
won (which not too many people do), he could win millions of $'s for himself or his charity!
Sorry folks, got to go to work now - but "I'll be baaaaack"!
It's freezing outside, where the hell is "global warming"??
Nation's infrastructure is collapsing, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
See, dummy Danny Zuker, who I never heard until this, started something that he couldn't finish-gutless and unwilling to take my bet!
It's 46º (really cold) and snowing in New York on Memorial Day - tell the so-called "scientists" that we want global warming right now!
Why is Senator John McCain in Syria visiting with the rebels- MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I like John McCain but we have to start rebuilding the United States instead of countries who hate us and want us to fail - be smart!
We spend billions of dollars helping nations all over the World but with hurricane Sandy and Oklahoma tornado not one nation helped us!
@VattenfallGroup, lead investor in Aberdeen windfarm fiasco, has dropped out—project not economically viable--& protestors hate it.
Additionally, two executives @VattenfallGroup are under major investigation & they are unable to get the many permits necessary.
Who would be stupid enough to invest in @VattenfallGroup's ill-conceived windfarm when it will lose £25M yearly?
John Menard of Menards home improvement stores in Midwest treats employees horribly -- should they form a union?
I commend Roger Ailes for publicly supporting @FoxNews’ employees against the Obama administration's intimidation of its reporters.
Inflation is here..
@robbreport Best 2013 Golf Courses: Trump Int'l Golf Links Scotland.
Great honor, great magazine—thanks!
The new amnesty bill is over 1000 pages.
It is another monstrosity a la ObamaCare..
@TimTebow has tremendous talent and a proven ability to lead.
He deserves to be in the @nfl.
House GOP better get its act together.
Defund ObamaCare.
Out negotiate on debt ceiling.
Form commissions on Benghazi & IRS.
No excuses!
Military has announced that China has successfully hacked our advanced weapon designs.
China is our enemy.
Should we offset this on our debt?
China has done great under Obama.
Increased private US holdings by 500%.
Hacks our military & R&D.
Robs us blind daily..
@TrumpCollection’s @DoralResort renovations are  revitalizing Miami.
Little Mac Miller’s next album may bomb.
He can’t use my name again for sales..
@VattenfallGroup will never solve the issues with the Ministry of Defense.
Besides, they smartly just left the project.
Frack now and frack fast unless we want to continue to be dependent on countries that hate us.
Young entrepreneurs should always remember that if you do not promote yourself, no one else will!
The Yankees really have to be embarrassed losing all four games to the Mets - my great friend George Steinbrenner would be going nuts!
Serious stuff-IRS Commissioner visited White House 157 times, far more than Sec.
of State or Defense.
What a big story this is!
Today, Judge St. Eve ruled in my favor on the two remaining claims brought by Goldberg in Chicago.
Ms. Goldberg & her blowhard lawyer should be ashamed for having brought this frivolous case.
They should pay me damages!
Just got a great new selection of ties & shirts @Macys.
Go buy them now for Father’s Day—they’re beautiful!
Thank you to the Robb Report, The Best of the Best issue, for just naming Trump International Golf Links the Best New Golf Course In World!
Congratulations to Aberdeen and Scotland for just having our great golf course named Best New Course In World by The Robb Report.
Pres.
Obama is meeting with China’s Pres..
The Miami Heat looked great tonight - congratulations from all of your friends at your favorite place in Miami, Trump National Doral.
Armed Forces are in total turmoil!
Congratulations to my head pro of Trump International Golf Club (Florida) John Nieporte for qualifying for the U.S. Open!
Whitey Bulger’s prosecution starts today.
Will be one of the most interesting and intriguing trials.
Congratulations to Jim Herman, my ass't golf pro at Trump Nat'l Golf Club/Bedminster, NJ for qualifying for the U.S. Open!
Does anyone else have two golf pros—John Nieporte & Jim Herman—who qualified for the U.S. Open?
Could this be an all-time record?
The two dumbest interviews in history may go down as Lance Armstrong, who is being sued by everyone in the world, & Michael Douglas.
I will be going to Aberdeen, Scotland today to help my team celebrate the great success of Trump International Golf Links-press conference.
My son @EricTrump has just done another great event and raised a lot of money for @StJude.
He is a really good boy who loves helping kids.
Thanks to @johnrich for putting on such a great concert fot @Stjude.
John was a winner on Celebrity Apprentice and is a fantastic guy.
According to Bill O'Reilly, 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add Hispanics, that figure goes to 98%.
Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed.
When it comes to violent crime, and if we are going to solve the problem, we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is!
Likewise, the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities.
These people want LAW AND ORDER now!
I can't believe the Yankees continue to pay A Rod - they have a perfect right to stop paying (and should have stopped a long time ago).
George Steinbrenner would have done a major number on A Rod - there is no way he would have gotten paid, even with the help of the union!
Pete Rose should now be allowed in The Baseball Hall of Fame.
The all-time hits leader has paid the price already!
Giving away money and revolutionizing crowdfunding.
A-Rod has disgraced the blessed @Yankees organization, lied to the fans & embarrassed NYC.
He does not deserve to wear the pinstripes.
Kern County, CA has secured $1.
Dress your best.
Remember Trump ties & shirts @Macys for Fathers Day--your father will love you even more!
I've done the largest house sale in U.S. history by selling a Palm Beach mansion for $100M, $60M more than I paid.
I love real estate.
I feel bad for all @VanityFair employees.
Every day at work, they see circulation going down as Graydon runs his bad food restaurants.
We look forward to making the Old Post Office in DC one of the great hotels of the World.
I'm in Scotland getting ready for a major news conference on the Great Dunes of Scotland announcing the second North Sea course - amazing!
Newsstand sales for @VanityFair, run by sleepy Graydon Carter, are down almost 20%.
All he cares about are his bad food restaurants!
@foxandfriends int.
on gov.
A coincidence that the NSA leaker is living openly in Hong Kong?!
At the same time the Chinese Pres.
met with Obama in CA.
Somerset County, New Jersey SWAT Team- really fantastic people!
Shirts and ties are doing great @Macys--thanks!
Great going to Bob Kraft & Bill Belichick of the @Patriots on @TimTebow.
Tim is a winner just like them!
Please don’t pay attention to all of those phony tweets that mention my twitter handle relative to “diet” -- it is a total scam..
Belated congratulations to @serenawilliams on winning the French Open.
A great player & person!
With so many scandals plaguing Obama, it seems that they all hit him at the right time.
Could help him get away w/ all of them.
Congrats to @BarbaraJWalters on winning  the @MadeinNY Mayor's Award for Lifetime Achievement!
I love Barbara!
Keep stimulating your mind with big ideas.
Fill your mind with new information, & use this information to spawn new ideas..
@VattenfallGroup has topped Carbon Data’s rankings of the most carbon-intensive companies in the EU’s emissions trading scheme.
Amazing… @VattenfallGroup tried to destroy Aberdeen.
Wow, sexual assaults in the military have gone through the roof, far worse than anybody could have predicted!
I've been warning about China since as early as the 80’s.
No one wanted to listen.
Now our country is in real trouble.
If Snowden was such a hero then he would be in America.
He is escaping justice!
@DannyZuker You’re starting up again because people have forgotten you..
@DannyZuker Danny—Let your bosses on Modern Family lend you the money to play the game.
Show courage!
Looking forward to speaking at @ralphreed’s @FaithandFreedom Gala Dinner on Friday in D.C. His staff has been great!
@DannyZuker  Danny--You're a total loser!
I can't resist hitting lightweight @DannyZuker verbally when he starts up because he is just.
so pathetic and easy (stupid)!
Why isn’t the @GOP congress doing everything possible to defund and cut ObamaCare?
Is it a coincidence that the Middle East has blown up since Obama became president?
Lightweight @DannyZuker is too stupid to see that China (and others) is destroying the U.S. economically and our leaders are helpless!
SAD.
Just tried watching Modern Family - written by a moron, really boring.
Writer has the mind of a very dumb and backward child.
Sorry Danny!
Thanks to everyone for your kind birthday wishes -- very nice!
Challenges present opportunities.
Always keep your focus and stay calm.
It’s Thursday.
How much has OPEC ripped us off today?
Still a great time to buy residential property.
The courts are holding up foreclosures.
Buy directly from the banks.
A friend of mine went to @CakeBossBuddy and sent me this beautiful cake which we put in the atrium of @TrumpTowerNY..
@IvankaTrump and I are looking forward to visiting Vancouver next week.
Father’s Day is Sunday.
Find the perfect gift.
Watch Miss USA 2013 Sunday night at 9 PM ET.
Live from Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas..
@GiulianaRancic & @nickjonas are co-hosting Miss USA 2013 -- Sunday night at 9 PM ET on NBC.
@JonasBrothers will be performing.
Tune in!
Happy Father's Day to all, even the haters and losers!
We should stay the hell out of Syria, the "rebels" are just as bad as the current regime.
WHAT WILL WE GET FOR OUR LIVES AND $ BILLIONS?
A family in Las Vegas just stopped a violent home invasion by shooting one of the perpetrators-the other fled and will be captured.
Great!
Congratulations to Connecticut’s Erin Brady on being crowned the 2013 @MissUSA!
America will be well-represented in @MissUniverse!
@GiulianaRancic & @nickjonas both did a wonderful job hosting @MissUSA!
Everyone loved @JonasBrothers & @DJPaulyD’s performances!
Congratulations to @EmilyMiller, @mboyle1 & @NolteNC on making @FishbowlDC’s list of "10 Journos You Don't Want to Fight on Twitter".
My @gretawire int.
Trending story on Miss Utah is very unfair.
She simply lost her train of thought—could happen to anyone!
A country that does not control or respect its own borders is a country destined for failure.
Secure our borders!
I own @DannyZuker, but he has his friends & haters & losers tweeting that he beat me.
He can’t beat me at anything!
Frankly, for a writer, I don’t think @DannyZuker’s stuff is good.
In fact, it’s terrible.
Like it or not, haters and losers, everybody is talking about Miss U.S.A. and Miss Utah.
By the way she is a fine young woman-unfair to her.
Snowden is sitting in China and taunting the U.S.
He is mocking us as a Country.
Snowden is doing great damage to our relations with other countries and U.S.prestige.
All I can say is that if I were President, Snowden would have already been returned to the U.S. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology!
Keep testing your limits.
Never become complacent.
Always think big!
Young entrepreneurs – never back down.
Take the hits and get up.
That’s what makes a winner.
I met a Trump Twitter hater last night (well known).
As he came near me he nervously said, "Mr. Trump, it is an honor to meet you sir"!
The Miss Universe Pageant will be broadcast live from MOSCOW, RUSSIA on November 9th.
A big deal that will bring our countries together!
The Miami Heat is getting it's ass kicked - they better start playing or it will be a long Summer for them.
Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?
Great basketball game going on right now!
Watch the game-really good.
Amazing comeback by The Heat - your friends at your favorite golf club, Trump National Doral, are proud of you.
NOW for game 7!
@Ed_Klein’s book ‘The Amateur’ is out in paper back.
Lots of insights.
Great to see @SarahPalinUSA back on @FoxNews.
She's a wonderful woman and commentator.
I salute all Tea Party Patriots for marching on DC today.
Stand strong!
I never made the ridiculous comment about James G. and Obama Care - somebody else put it out and attributed it to me.
Not my style!
Who would really believe I would say such a thing about a guy I truly liked, James Gandolfini.
Sadly, very sick people use my name.
Some dope said I deleted a tweet about James G. There was no tweet and there was no delete-a totally fabricated story (nobody saw tweet).
James Gandolfini was a remarkable talent.
He was also a decent man.
We will all miss him.
We know who did the hoax of James Gandolfini and ObamaCare.
Be careful, Mister.
Our debt is about to reach $17T.
Iraq has $20T in oil reserves.
Interesting.
Negotiation is persuasion more than power.
Negotiation includes a lot of fine lines--and that's what makes it an art.
Keep focused on your goals.
Practice positive thinking.
View any conflict as an opportunity--look at the solution, not the problem.
Re negotiation: Trust your instincts even after you've honed your skills.
They're there for a reason..
@GovernorPerry stopped by to say hello.
My people caught the person who committed "forgery" of the James Gandolfini-Obama Care phoney quote attributed to me-fraud.
Arrest coming?
After one of the great chokes in the history of sports, it will be hard for the Spurs to beat the Heat - but who knows.
Good game on now!
Vision remains vision until you focus, do the work, and bring it down to earth where it will do some good.
The best investors are visionaries—they look beyond the present.
Due diligence includes increasing your financial IQ daily.
Putin says Russia can’t allow a weakening of its nuclear deterrent—U.S. wants to reduce—are we crazy?
Receiving the @RobbReport trophy for best new golf course in the world- Trump International Golf Links Scotland.
Even liberals & Democrats think Eric Schneiderman’s use of the Atty General’s office is unfair & unethical.
Excited and honored to be addressing @theFAMiLYLEADER summit in Iowa this August.
We are being embarrassed by Russia and China on Snowden (and much more) yet Obama is talking about global warming on Tuesday.
Snowden is showing how weak the U.S. has become.
Our debt is about to top $17T.
ObamaCare and China (& others) are killing American business.
Yesterday, 15 @GOP senators sided with people who got into this country by breaking our laws.
Becoming a US citizen is not a right, it’s a privilege.
We need to worry about the American worker first!
Looking forward to my @theFAMiLYLEADER summit visit and speech.
New and great selection of ties, shirts and cufflinks@Macy's - check them out!
The people of Scotland love the golf course I have built-it is now considered perhaps the greatest ever built!
Paula Deen made a big mistake in using a forbidden word but must be given some credit fot admitting her mistake.
She will be back!
One of the most expensive projects ever in Miami @TrumpDoral’s $200M of renovations are right on schedule.
When completed, will be elite!
Shining over Fifth Avenue, @TrumpTowerNY (a NY icon) offers a full service restaurant, bar, cafe, ice cream parlor and Gucci.
Obama’s speech on climate change was scary.
It will lower our standard of living and raise costs of fuel & food for everyone.
China loved Obama’s climate change speech yesterday.
They laughed!
It hastens their takeover of us as the leading world economy.
As hard as it is to believe, sexting pervert Anthony Weiner is leading in some polls for Mayor of NYC..
@tomhanks was fabulous in @LuckyGuyPlay last night—as was the entire cast.
What a surprise!
Why do we always know how the four liberals are going to rule but have to think about which side the Republican judges will go.
Remember, but for Conservatives, Bush would have given us not only Roberts but also Harriet Miers.
Face it, Bush was terrible!
Whether you like it or not, Bush also gave us Obama!
There are huge opportunities for profits if you can think big & create big solutions for the human needs brought by trends.
Call it any way you like, but Snowden is a traitor.
When our country was great do you know what we did to traitors?
Putin re Snowden issue “it is like shearing a pig: there’s lots of squealing and little fleece”.
Keep difficulties in perspective.
Ask yourself "is this a blip or is it a catastrophe"?
Can you imagine not taking Snowden's passport away before he jetted happily away to foreign lands (where he gave away many U.S. secrets).
How did Snowden, with not even a high school education, get access to top secret U.S. records.
He then gave, or sold, those records-traitor!
Another example of the destruction caused by wind turbines.
Unnecessary waste--horrible!
Obama’s carbon tax plan will finance more windmills in America.
More real estate depreciated, wildlife killed, incl.
Great move by Jeff Zucker.
I don't get @billmaher and his terrible show - he is dumb as a rock but tries so hard to pass himself off as a great intellect.
Check past!
You mean the fact that my father left me some money (as a good father will) and I multiplied it many, many times to over $10 billion-is bad?
What my father really gave me is a good (great) brain, motivation and the benefit of his experience-unlike the haters and losers (lazy!
).
I like doing this once a month for the haters & losers (and as they know)-I don't wear a "wig".
Everytime someone tweets that I wear a wig realize to yourself that you are dealing with "them" - just another sad & lonely hater and loser!
Just watched Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on 60 Minutes.
She should spend more time trying to get the F stock price up & less on her ego!
I am so disappointed that the Yankeed haven't terminatrd A-Rod's contract.
There is no way they would not win in court!
Hard to believe.
I am going to Trump National Doral in Miami this week to check out the $250 million renovation.
In construction, always watch the money!
Every penny of the $7 billion going to Africa as per Obama will be stolen - corruption is rampant!
Edward Snowden is absolutely killing the the U.S. with other countries!
Fox and.
Friends now!
Our thoughts and prayers are w/ the families of the 19 brave firefighters who died fighting the Arizona wildfire.
God bless them.
Congratulations to @secupp on joining @newtgingrich on @CNN’s Crossfire.
Show will be excellent!
We should be concerned about the American worker & invest here.
Not grant amnesty to illegals or waste $7B in Africa.
Yesterday Obama compared Nelson Mandela to George Washington in Africa.
Do you think he really believes it?
Anti-Morsi protests are 10 times larger than 2011 anti-Mubarek protests.
Interesting.
Snowden, if you’re such a hero then come back home and face justice.
In reality, you are just another wiseguy traitor.
I don’t know Dennis Kozlowski, who made Tyco into a great company & then went to prison, but he’s up for parole—let him go!
I am honored to be receiving the American Spectator Foundation Award for excellence in entrepreneurialism in Washington DC this fall..
@Yankees are making a big mistake sending the doping @AROD to rehab assignment.
Should suspend him until investigation is over..
Oil prices just went over $100 per barrel for first time in nine months!
Wow, Obama Care just got delayed by over a year because it is so complicated it cannot be understood - the beginning of the end!
He would be crazy to play in L.A. - really bad coach who can't adjust to his players!
Nice article on Trump Links at Ferry Point in today's New York Post - the construction is going really well!
I just arrived in Miami where I will be checking out construction of the brand new Trump National Doral - always closely watch construction!
In 2011 I said that Mubarak never should have been ousted because whoever replaces him will be worse.
Obama made a mistake.
Stop and frisk works.
Instead of criticizing @NY_POLICE Chief Ray Kelly, New Yorkers should be thanking him for keeping NY safe.
Obama-Putin Moscow meeting on 9.
Leaving Miami-Trump National Doral will be GREAT!
Sorry folks, I'm just not a fan of sharks - and don't worry, they will be around long after we are gone.
Sharks are last on my list - other than perhaps the losers and haters of the World!
My son @EricTrump and @LaraLeaYunaska just announced their engagement.
Great news!
A wonderful couple!
The "Arab Spring" is not working out so well-nice name, bad results!
To all of those who asked, I predicted two weeks ago and again last night that Dwight Howard would go to Houston.
Do I get congrats-insight?
Dwight Howard just signed with Houston.
Just heard that the great Golf Week Magazine named my Trump International Golf Course-Scotland The Best Modern Day Golf Course In The World!
Would seem that plane landed short of runway in San Francisco!
Anderson Silva just got knocked out by new champion Chris Weidman!
Congrats to Chris.
Isn’t it ironic that a lot of the wealthy environmentalists use private jets and fight wind farms being placed near their property?
We should not cut any aid to Egypt.
Their country is in chaos and now they must form a normal civil government.
Based on John Sweeney's lousy reputation, we are airing large parts of the interview that were not shown- enjoy!
Was not mentioned that we built one of the great golf courses in the world- bringing tremendous business to Scotland.
With Spitzer & Anthony Weiner running for office, New York  is pervert central!
It’s Tuesday.
How much money will Karl Rove waste today trying to push amnesty through the House?
Pakistani intelligence had full knowledge that Bin Laden was living in Abbottabad.
They were sheltering him..
@TIME Magazine should definitely pick David Pecker to run things over there - he'd make it exciting and win awards!
What took investigators so long to interview the pilots of Asiana San Fran crash?
WHY NO DRUG TESTS FOR PILOTS-they were really "off".
The San Fran crash was totally the pilot's fault - may be too late for drug testing, RIDICULOUS!
It probably was not drugs that caused the San Fran crash, but why aren't they testing - who knows?
Eliot Spitzer was a horrible Governor and A.G. who ruined many good people and cost the Country billions of dollars in losses (and jobs).
With the two wacko perverts--Spitzer and Weiner--NYC politics has become a joke all over the world..
@IamStevenT visited me at @TrumpTowerNY- what a great guy!
Great news that @ehasselbeck will be joining @foxandfriends.
Elisabeth is a tremendous person and will be missed on @theviewtv.
Congratulations to Gretchen Carlson on her big move to hosting an afternoon solo show this fall on @FoxNews..
Interesting…the last time a Democrat succeeded a two-term Democratic pres.
was in 1836 when Martin Van Buren succeeded Andrew Jackson.
Getting rid of the mortgage interest deduction would be a disaster for homeowners, who have suffered enough!
Just as I predicted, ObamaCare is a complete disaster which is failing on its own.
May never be fully implemented.
Why should ObamaCare be delayed for businesses and not working families?
With premiums rising at record levels, it is not equitable.
Lying traitor Snowden now claims that he did not give any information to the Russians or Chinese.
Why doesn’t he come home then?
Derek Jeter’s rehab assignment is progressing on schedule.
He's a true @Yankees captain.
Do not view any failure as the end.
Learn your lessons quickly, then move on.
Do not dwell on failure.
Start thinking big again.
Snowden has given serious information to China and Russia-anyone who thinks otherwise is a dope!
He is a traitor who fled-he knew the crime!
@TrumpDoral’s record $200M renovations are on schedule.
The hotel remains open for guests, events and conferences.
A woman is suing one of my businesses despite the fact that she loved her classes.
Our legal system is a mess.
Russia should hand over Snowden to the U.S. but they are having too much fun taunting our leaders.
I wonder if traitor Edward Snowden will be attending the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow on November 9th.
Perhaps Miss USA can lure Snowden back?
I would invite Edward Snowden to be a judge at the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow but would be concerned that he would sell results early!
Spitzer failed as A.G., failed as Governor in disgrace, and was fired on all T.V. shows (boring and zero ratings), and he's at it again!
My @foxandfriends int.
on the Zimmerman trial & verdict, courage of the jury and reactions!
All NYC needs is the mentally unstable Elliot Spitzer in office again.
Eliot Spitzer’s illegal, frivolous & over reaching harassment of Hank Greenberg at AIG played a major part in 2008 financial meltdown.
Be careful – sexting pervert Anthony Weiner is upping his campaigning.
When will new pictures be released?
Ready to get mad?!
ObamaCare will cost 3 times as much as Obama promised – $2.
Now A-Rod doesn’t even show up to his single-A rehab games.
Maybe the @Yankees will get lucky and @MLB will suspend A-Rod.
Obama will eventually approve the Keystone XL pipeline--has to happen but it is very late!
Had a great time on @IngrahamAngle this morning..
@ArceePalabrica @realDonaldTrump "Midas Touch is the manual for entrepreneurs who want to succeed.
Traitor Snowden has requested asylum in Russia.
Why would Russia grant it?
Snowden already gave them all the intel he stole!
Weiner and Spitzer are on top of the latest polls.
A sad day for the greatest city on earth!
They will spend lots of time together.
Give a lot of credit to Carlos Beltran for developing into a terrific baseball player and total winner for the Cardinals-great going Carlos!
American league wins!
Be totally focused.
Being successful requires nothing less than 100% of your concentrated effort.
Mariano Rivera is one of top @Yankees of all time.
Greatest closer of all time.
A true warrior.
Last night's MVP award well-deserved.
Fun fact for my 2M+ followers - the 'Architect' Karl Rove blew $400M in the 2012 election with a success rate of 1.6%..
@jacknicklaus has done a GREAT job as the architect of my new golf course at Ferry Point.
NYC is very proud!
Only in America can a Jihadi thug who murdered women and children be nursed back to health & then get a @RollingStone cover.
The 2013 Trump @MissUniverse Pageant comes to Moscow on November 9th.
Airing from Crocus City Hall on @nbc!
@MissUSA Erin Brady is doing a fantastic job representing Trump Miss USA.
Smart, gorgeous--a really positive force!
@IsraeliPM @netanyahu is a resolute leader.
When he sets a red line, it stands!
The Zimmerman trial is over.
It is time to move on.
While Zimmerman is no angel, he was acquitted and should be able to move on.
Sad thing is Rolling Stone was (is) a dead magazine with big downward circulation and now, for them at last, people are talking about it!
Don't talk about Rolling Stone Magazine but, most importantly, don't buy it.
This degenerate killed and maimed so many wonderful people!
Why is the @GOP congress focusing on amnesty when so many Americans are unemployed?
@GOP congress needs to actually defund ObamaCare, not waste time passing non-binding resolutions..
@bigstack19 "@realDonaldTrump Does anyone actually read Rolling Stone anymore?
Go to @Macys now to see the incredible new selection of Trump Signature Collection ties, shirts and suits..
@youngmman "@realDonaldTrump Conrad Hilton was a great man but Barron Hilton is a dope".
Wrong on Barron!
Congratulations to @KingJames on winning Athlete of the Year in last night’s @ESPYS.
LeBron is also a great guy!
The Fed’s pumping is great news in the short term but it can’t last forever.
Be prudent in your market investing.
Whether you love, like or hate Donald Trump, I will be on Bill O'Reilly (Fox) tonight at 8.00.
Bill knows Trump is great for ratings!
For the disciples of global warming, in 150 summers (years) there have been 20 heat waves as bad or worse than current-this has happened b4!
On Bill O'Reilly in 5 minutes!
Re-run of O'Reilly on Fox NOW!
@AndreaTantaros’s radio show is a great addition to talk radio.
She is sharp, talented, & great sense of humor.
Congratulations.
Detroit is going through very hard times right now..
If they are smart, brighter days are ahead..
@AS_ScienceGuy                      "@realDonaldTrump Thank you for all your support of @autismspeaks Great new breakthroughs".
Fantastic!
Some good news for New York – Weiner has dropped 12 points in the polls & that is before more of the pervert’s old texts are released.
Our GDP has been growing less than 2% for the last 5 years.
ObamaCare will slow us down even more.
Has to be repealed.
The ties, shirts and suits at Macy's are doing fantastically well-check out the new designs and low prices-nothing better!
Also, The Donald J. Trump Signature mattress from SERTA is doing record business-call Serta and see why!
Will be on Fox & Friends in 3 minutes-7.
Apple is finally considering a large screen for the I-Phone-they better get moving fast.
China is building 50 brand new airports while our country continues to rott!
Very sad.
That country is a time bomb waiting to happen-a total corrupt mess!
China is taking the oil from Iraq after we spent 1.5 trillion dollars and thousands of lives for their "freedom".
Our leaders are so stupid!
Baseball player Ryan Braun turned out to be a total con man after so vociferously proclaiming his innocence only to be guilty as.
hell!
Word is that they have far more evidence on A-Rod than they have on Ryan Braun!
Alex is over.
If you've got some problems today, that's a good sign--that's life.
So give them some thought and make the most of the situation.
ginrnnr2                     "@realDonaldTrump ...
is China economy in a "bubble""?
Only if we want it to be!
No surprise, serial sexter Anthony continues to be a sick pervert.
Phil Mickelson’s final 66 round in @The_Open was amazing.
Congrats on his well-deserved win.
Amazing competitor & a great guy!
This is the summer of box office bombs.
Who is green lighting this garbage?
The scripts are terrible..
@AROD is back on the DL.
The coming suspension will be announced soon by @MLB.
As I told everyone once before, Wiener is a sick puppy who will never change-100% of perverts go back to their ways.
Remember, Anthony Wiener continued sending sick pics.
long after his resignation from Congress and his apology-zero control over himself!
On Anthony Wiener, I TOLD YOU SO!
I am doing Greta tonight on Fox - talking about Obama Care and pervert Anthony Wiener!
Greta in a few minutes-will be interesting!
Bloomberg News - Spain's renewable projects, lead by money losing wind turbines, facing bankruptcy.
Hopefully Scotland is watching!
Vattenfall, the promoter of the money losing wind farm plan in Aberdeen, Scotland, just took a loss of $4.
More and more reporters are using the word TRUMP when referring to winning--just used on Bloomberg News.
Gee, I wonder why?
We all know that chess is a game of strategy.
So is business.
Think about that and develop a strategy starting today.
Today Obama will give another speech on the economy.
Tomorrow our country will still be $17T+ in debt with 18% real unemployment.
My @gretawire int.
My comment last March - “Anthony Weiner is a sick pervert, you think he will change?
He will never change”.
For the sake of New York City, all recent sexting victims of Anthony ‘Carlos Danger’ Weiner should come forward.
I can’t believe Apple isn’t moving faster to create a larger iPhone screen.
Bring back Steve Jobs!
Isn’t it sad that Weiner’s first press conference with wife Huma was yesterday admitting to a sext he made post-resignation & apology!
I've just started blocking out some of the repetitive and boring (& dumb) haters and losers.
They are a waste of time and energy!
Don't ever think you've done it all already or that you've done your best.
That's a shortcut to undermining your own potential.
Getting ready to leave @TrumpDoral and the brand new Blue Monster course--it's unbelievable!
The 250 million dollar construction of Trump Nationsl Doral is coming along great.
Just left Miami where I toured entire project.
AMAZING!
Wacko pervert @AnthonyWeiner’s idea of Hispanic outreach is using Carlos Danger as his sexting.
He’s an insensitive racist.
Druggie @AROD is now scheming to sue the @Yankees.
He will go down as the biggest sports embarrassment of all time.
The U.S. is now "begging" Russia to give back Edward Snowden.
In a letter they promised no death penalty for the traitor.
No respect!
Don't tread water.
Get out there and go for it.
There's nothing wrong with bringing your talents to the surface.
Negotiation tip: Be patient, be persistent, be stubborn.
Know exactly what you want and keep it to yourself.
Negotiation tip: Think about what the other side wants.
Know where they're coming from.
Try to create a win/win situation.
Negotiation tip: Be reasonable & flexible.
Being open to change could lead you into a fortunate situation and open the door to innovation.
The Golden Rule of Negotiating:  He who has the gold makes the rules.
The best way out is always through.
Without passion you don't have energy, without energy you have nothing!
Poll numbers have nosedived for pervert NYC mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner- good news for New York!
Congratulations to @DianeSawyer on her big ratings win for the evening news.
Diane is a spectacular person.
Looking forward to keynoting @bobvanderplaats’ @theFAMiLYLEADER Leadership Summit.
Be sure to listen to my interview on tonight’s @SteveDeaceShow.
Steve is a terrific guy!
Great piece by @EWErickson @RedState exposing how Karl 1.
Surprise?
Obama believes Benghazi is a “phony scandal”.
Nothing phony about Americans being killed by Islamists.
Just like @Yankee organization, I can’t wait for @MLB to suspend A-Rod.
Will be a great day for the sport.
Now with the Danger-Weiner campaign dead, time to focus on crazy Eliot Spitzer.
A man who has never earned 10 cents in his life.
When I jokingly said "bring back Steve Jobs to run Apple" because Apple has not been doing well, the haters & losers had a field day!
Sad.
Who knew this innocent kid would grow into a monster?
I wonder who @ArsenioHall's first guest will be---- his show will be great!
My @SteveDeaceShow int.
Be sure to keep following announcements on the development of Trump International Golf Club Dubai.
Will be spectacular.
A sad day for America with Snowden being granted asylum in Russia.
Putin is laughing at Obama.
Snowden is handing over to Russia a treasure trove of intel.
Our politicians are incapable of dealing!
Chris @hardball_chris Matthews ratings are at new historic lows.
He is single-handedly destroying the entire @msnbc channel.
I am getting worried about Chris @hardball_chris Matthews.
Is he drinking again?
It is a great victory for NYC that A-Rod will never wear pinstripes again.
Wow!
Does Eliot Spitzer have a girlfriend?
This is getting exciting.
People don’t know that Eliot’s father is very rich.
Eliot likes to pretend he’s poor to appeal to voters.
Eliot better have a great pre-nup—I want to help Silda in her negotiation.
Isn't it sad the way Putin is toying with Obama regarding Snowden.
We look weak and pathetic.
Could not happen with.
a strong leader!
Over 35 CIA operatives were on the ground in Benghazi the night of the 9.
Do as I say, not as I do.
Keystone XL should be approved but more importantly we should be drilling & fracking our own resources.
Would be an economic windfall.
Less than ten days until I keynote @bobvanderplaats’ @theFAMiLYLEADER Leadership Summit.
Tix going fast.
Let me sum this up for you...
A good question for would-be entrepreneurs to ask themselves:  What am I pretending not to see?
There are a lot of opportunities out there.
Do not settle for remaining in your comfort zone.
Being complacent is a good way to get nowhere.
Get your momentum going and keep it going.
OmikronDreamer            "@realDonaldTrump do you wear your own ties"?
Yes.
Take your work seriously, take yourself less seriously.
It’s a great recipe for some good times & great memories.
We.
signed our deal to take over the historic Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Ave.
from the U.S. and convert it into super luxury hotel-jobs!
The Old Post Office building in Washington (D.C.) will soon be transformed into one of the great hotels anywhere in the world-lots of jobs!
Why has all time hits leader Pete Rose paid a 20 year price whrn A-Rod gets 200 game penalty.
It's time to let Pete into The Hall of Fame!
Let @PeteRose in the HOF - it's time!
The Trump Organization is honored to have been awarded the redevelopment of The Old Post Office.
Will be DC's finest hotel...
Ft.
Hood Jihadi Nidal Hassan has been paid over $300g in Army salary while on trial.
His victims are deprived of any benefits...
Do not underestimate yourself, and know you are able to handle what comes your way by increasing your leverage.
Being true to yourself equals being true to your brand.
That’s the solid foundation that will keep your brand flourishing.
Obama should meet with Putin snd convince him to do what is good for the U.S.  It's called good dealmaking or, simply, leadership!
Cajole.
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd—one of the dumbest voices in politics-- is angry that I’m doing @ThisWeekABC.
Doesn’t dummy @chucktodd realize that when I considered running for president, I filed financial papers showing unbelievable numbers.
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd, when looking at my financial filings, should’ve said “Great job Mr. Trump, Sir”.
Blackdog, Scotland, started a petition against @VattenfallGroup..
@JustinRose99 Great playing--we are proud of you!
@AScottPGA  Really solid playing--keep going!
In the latest poll, Danger-Weiner’s numbers have sunk.
I wonder how Carlos handled the stress?
He is one whacko sicko sexter.
Re: hiring contractors, remember the cheapest isn't always the best.
Their work may have to be redone & they may not be reliable.
FACT – the reason why Americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because Obama refuses to pass a budget.
If FM @AlexSalmond needs to litter Scotland w/ ugly industrial wind turbines to gain independence, he will lose!
If the gov't shuts down, it is because Obama wants to make working Americans buy ObamaCare while businesses and gov't are exempt..
@AlexSalmond is making a truly stupid mistake by forcing ugly industrial wind turbines down Scotland’s throat –he's hated for it.
First Minister @AlexSalmond will be destroying the beauty of Scotland with his insane desire for bird killing wind turbines.
Thank you @GolfMagazine for putting my Scotland course on your cover and a Top 100 course in the world.
Eliot had a terrible debate performance this morning against Scott Stringer.
He can’t spin his failing and contemptible public record.
Big crowd expected tomorrow night in Iowa.
It will be interesting and fun - great people!
I can't believe that in New York we can't watch the PGA Championsip on CBS.
How    .
much discount is Time Warner giving its customers?
Congratulations to @JasonDufner on winning the PGA championship.
Great job!
The failing @HuffingtonPost and dopey @ariannahuff are writing so much false junk about me-they just can't get enough!
BE CAREFUL.
Did the poor but smart to leave ex-husband of @ariannahuff get any of the dollars she got for the use of his name in really stupid AOL deal?
Not only is @Toure a racist (and boring), he's a really dumb guy!
Good.
morning, I'm going to work!
Still a buyer’s market but somewhat fragile.
Be sure to calculate the risk of rising rates coming sooner than you think!
Congrats to @mboyle1 of @BreitbartNews  for exposing Jason Linkins of @HuffingtonPost as a lightweight dope who gives false information.
The Patch, a total loser for @AOL, will be a good deal compared to @HuffingtonPost.
@ariannahuff laughs at “stupid” Armstrong!
@SenMikeLee refuted every point Karl 1.6% Rove made on the need to defund ObamaCare.
I missed the PGA Championship because it was not broadcast by TimeWarner @TWC.
Why aren’t they giving subscribers major discounts?
Re @TWC TimeWarner, I am going to be switching many of my buildings to another service—this is ridiculous!
I will be on Greta @gretawire tonight at 10 PM on Fox News.
Obama has exempted businesses, his staff and all of Congress from ObamaCare.
Why is he still forcing the monstrosity on the U.S.?
Looks like Anthony Weiner Is through-most recent poll has him deeply in last place.
Republicans have very strong hand in their fight against Obamacare-lets see if they are willing and able to play it "tuff"!
Don’t be easily pleased with yourself or with anything else.
Be tough & fight to keep your standards high.
In Miami tracking @TrumpDoral’s $250M renovations.
Will be America's top resort.
@PGATOUR just signed for 10 yr ext.
Things happen that make you question whether you should keep going.
As long as you are enjoying what you are doing, keep going.
Mark Levin's @marklevinshow 'The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic" is a truly great & important book.
Fact: without Texas and states reaping the fracking boom, Obama’s job record would go from bad to worse!
@GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP – ESTABLISH SELECT COMMITTEE ON BENGHAZI.
THERE IS A MASSIVE COVERUP.

Myself with mother and father at New York Military Academy.

High rank!
My interview with @ThisWeekABC w/@GStephanopoulos destroyed all Sunday competition w/ 2.52M total viewers…that’s why they want me on!
NIELSEN RATINGS: 1.
@ThisWeekABC, 2.52 viewers, 6 SHR,1.91RTG, .
@meetthepress 2.24 total viewers, 5 SHR,1.61RTG, .
Can’t wait for @DylanByers’ follow up @politico piece discussing my large Sunday news shows ratings win because of my interview!
Obama' ststement on Egypt was terrible and dumb-now being used by military as a rallying cry-our foreign policy is worst in U.S. history.
My motto is: ‘Never give up.
’ I follow this very strictly.
I do not let problems and challenges stop me; they are normal.
See problems as a mind exercise.
Enjoy the challenge---and remember to keep focused on your goals.
Keep an open mind--business is a creative endeavor.
Strive for innovative ideas.
We must leave "stop and frisk" for A-Rod and Anthony Weiner!
Let the Arab countries take care of Egypt-they have more to gain and plenty of money..
It's time for the U.S. to stop being stupid.
Re-build the United.
States not places that hate our country and everything we stand for!
So, lets get this right.
Steve Jobs dies and leaves his wife everything-billions of dollars.
Now his wife has a boyfriend (lover).
Oh Steve!
@NY_POLICE Commissioner Ray Kelly has done a top job keeping NYC safe.
Stop & Frisk has been a critical tool for the NYPD.
Chicago is a shooting disaster-they should immediately go to STOP AND FRISK.
They have no choice, hundreds of lives would be saved!
Our great project in South America, Trump Tower Punta Del Este in Uruguay, will have spectacular views and the....
@MattBevin: As someone well versed in job creation and the Private Sector, if you lie on your resume, You’re Fired!
With @stuartpstevens expected to represent @GovChristie in the Presidential race, Chris will have a very hard time winning..
@stuartpstevens did a horrible job for Mitt—is a refund in order?
Sadly, Stuart is a disaster!
Our country needs to reestablish the work ethic.
NYC is under constant threat from Jihadists & violent criminals.
Stop & Frisk keeps streets & subways safe.
It’s Tuesday.
How many terrible predictions and advice will Karl 1.6% Rove make today?
ObamaCare is an absolute disaster which will destroy 16% of the economy and ultimately more!
I will be doing Greta Van Susteren @gretawire tonight at 10 PM on Fox News, talking about China & Mitt's failed campaign team.
GRETA IN A FEW MINUTES-on Fox.
You must admit that Bryant Gumbel is one of the dumbest racists around - an arrogant dope with no talent.
Failed at CBS etc-why still on TV?
The hatchet job in @NYMag about Roger Ailes is total bullshit.
He is the ultimate winner who is surrounded by a great team.
Had a great time on @gretawire last night.
Greta always does great interviews.
Glad to see that the Egyptian Army is releasing Mubarek.
As we see, Obama never should have abandoned him.
He was an ally.
NYC politicians better stop pandering--ending stop & frisk would be a disaster..
@AlexSalmond  Heatwave in Scotland makes wind turbines useless.
Big problem, expensive mess.
Congress must defund ObamaCare.
It is destroying Medicare and breaking promises to our Seniors, including veterans.
It’s Wednesday.
How many times will A-Rod sue the @Yankees today?
A-Rod has no one to blame but himself for his predicament.
With Democrats Spitzer, Danger-Weiner & Filner, which party really has the war on women?
Re Miss Universe Pageant, we’ve spoken w/the LGBT community in Russia who asked “please don’t leave, it would send the wrong signal”.
One of Obama’s greatest failures will be his legacy of making millions completely dependent on government handouts, not work.
Time flies it’s @TrumpTowerNY’s 30th anniversary.
If Stop & Frisk is struck down by the pandering NYC politicians, increases in crime & eventual terrorist attacks will be on them.
With the whacko pervert Weiner about to be embarrassed, all women need to be on the lookout.
Sexting begins 9.
Why are people upset w/ me over Pres Obama’s birth certificate?
I got him to release it, or whatever it was, when nobody else could!
People should be proud of the fact that I got Obama to release his birth certificate, which in a recent book he “miraculously” found.
John McCain couldn’t get him to release “it” and neither could Hillary Clinton—but Donald did!
Anyway, I’m all about jobs & the economy & making America great again.
We’re falling fast!
Lightweight NYS Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is trying to extort me with a civil law suit.
Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman, after years of looking, file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)?
No case!
Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions?
Why did lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions?
Also, recent asks?
How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case - a total sleazebag!
After years of long stops then starts, why did dopey Eric Scheiderman tell people in The Trump Org.
What did our very stupid & ineffective A.G. Eric Schneidean, during his trips to MY office, tell me about President Obama & Governor Cuomo?
Wow, l just found out that A.G. Schneiderman met with President Obama in Syracuse on Thursday --- and sued me on Saturday!
Same as IRS etc.
Gov.
I really enjoyed doing the show circuit this AM discussing lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman & the terrible job he has done for NY.
Amazing!
Why isn’t AG Schneiderman going after Democrat Jon Corzine and the $1.4 billion that is “missing?
My @foxandfriends int.
destroying Schneiderman’s frivolous suit which he brought after meeting Obama on Thurs.
Thug Politics.
Lightweight hack Schneiderman meets with Obama on Thursday, then brings frivolous suit on Saturday.
See Schneiderman admit he spoke with Obama about “ongoing investigations".
I hope the NY tax payer appreciates the millions Schneiderman is about to waste on a small case.
I will litigate to victory.
Has AG Schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions?
We will find out.
The lightweight hack Schneiderman told Ivanka that the “case is weak" and more.
Meets with Obama & then files one day later.
There has been a systematic targeting of the Tea Party by the Obama administration.
Now Schneiderman goes after me.
No coincidence.
See @IvankaTrump on the cover of @HudsonMOD?
@FoxNews legal analyst & former prosecutor @kimguilfoyle destroyed hack Schneiderman’s suit on @FNTheFive yesterday.
She’s very sharp!
As I predicted long ago, the war in Iraq was a disaster for the U.S. Heading for civil war, there are bombings all over the place.
I have a dream that our country will be great again!
Young entrepreneurs – in an economic climate like this only the strong survive.
You can do it.
Think Big!
Josh8J4                    "@realDonaldTrump I have a dream that you will be president to make this country great again.
Congrats to @TimTebow on making @Patriots’ first cut.
Stay strong and positive!
We are all rooting for you.
Remember, all these ‘freedom fighters’ in Syria want to fly planes into our buildings.
The misery of Obama’s economic policies..
Do not settle for remaining in your comfort zone.
Being complacent is a good way to get nowhere.
Take control and move forward every day.
Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington.
He doesn't want to detract from his press & glory.
I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10!
Not bad but room for improvement!
Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria.
Why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise?
That said, the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess, not us.
We should start rebuilding our own country & military.
I wonder what the great generals like Patton, the big M, or Robert E. LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack?
If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia), as they say in the movies, SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER!
Let the Arab League take care of Syria.
Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?
The United States needs to fix its own problems, of which there are many, first!
Wow, @CNBC ratings are really low, worst in many years.
I guess I'll have to start doing my Tuesday morning interviews with them again!
The Yankees are sure lucky George Steinbrenner is not around.
A lot of people would be losing their jobs.
If Christian Bale turned down $50M to return as Batman he should have his head examined.
What was he thinking?!
Thx Mark--I appreciate your words about the school.
You sound like you're doing well--happy for you.
Congress must protect our borders first.
Amnesty should be done only if the border is secure and illegal immigration has stopped.
What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict?
Obama needs Congressional approval.
What a shame that @msnbc’s ratings have sunk even lower in 2013.
Prime time down 50%.
People are really liking the new ties and shirts @Macy's-they are amazing and selling great!
In that @TimeWarner has @HBO with really dumb racist  Bryant Gumbel(and I mean dumb), and no CBS (which fired Bryant), I am switching bldgs.
I hope everyone read the brilliant article in American Spectator about leightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman.
He should be run out of office!
So, a woman in Chicago, who never had a job, has 9 kids with 7 different men (she is one of many).
These kids will never work.
Trouble!
Pervert Weiner is dead in his race for mayor of NYC but WOW, Eliot Spitzer has dropped way down in recent poll for comptroller.
SLEAZE!
Dress for success.
The ratings of The Cycle on MSNBC, a sad and pathetic show, are way down.
If they fired racist moron @Toure, a truly stupid guy, they live!
Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria?
Our leaders don't know what they are doing!
If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the U.S. will look very bad!
How bad has our "leader" made us look on Syria.
Stay out of Syria, we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.
The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not!
For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what, when and where they will be doing in a future attack!
Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our "talk" - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.
Amazing!
Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes.
Obama now just wants to save face, Russia is now telling him "don't do it".
He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.
China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess.
They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-& laugh at us!
Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III.
Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us.
He couldn't even get Britain!
NO LEADERSHIP.
President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!
It is truly amateur hour at the White House - and this is why we should not be doing the "war thing" right now!
The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria, but they want us to attack.
Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops?
They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves!
We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history.
Syria is now fully prepared!
In war, the elememt of surprise is sooooo important.
What the hell is Obama doing.
Each time I see one of Anthony Weiner's television ads for mayor I ask, what the hell is he doing just wasting money & time-go get a job!
Eliot Spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done, and now he wants to be comptroller.
Thrown out of politics and off of TV, CRAZY!
Our country is looking very bad right now!
If the U.S. attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets, killing civilians, there will be worldwide hell to pay.
Think of it, the Arab League doesn't want to get involved with Syria - but they want us to do their dirty work.
How stupid!
President Obama's "Arab Spring" is not looking so good right now!
Enjoy the ratings of President Obama.
China, OPEC and Russia laugh at us.
But now thanks to Obama so does Syria.
Very sad!
I am giving away money.
How can General Martin Dempsey tell Obama that delaying the Syria bombardment will have no consequences?
He is no Patton or MacArthur.
Elections have consequences.
From the great author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad-- Robert Kiyosaki-- here is a very nice article.
The great GENERALS MacArthur and Patton, real leaders and fighters, are spinning in their graves as we give Syria info & time to prepare.
What I am saying is stay out of Syria.
For all of those fools that want to attack Syria, the U.S.has lost the vital element of surprise-so stupid-could be a disaster!
Congratulations to @PiersMorgan on winning @BritishGQ TV Personality Of The Year.
Piers deserves his success!
Many Syrian ‘rebels’ are radical Jihadis.
Not our friends & supporting them doesn't serve our national interest.
Stay out of Syria!
@serenawilliams had a flawless @usopen quarterfinal win last night.
She’s a great player and a wonderful person..
@GOP must stay focused on defunding ObamaCare and the impending budget battle.
Don’t let Syria rule the agenda.
Happy New Year to all of my Jewish friends and supporters.
Shana Tova.
Hopefully it will be a great year!
I’ve always defended @jayleno but he never defends me.
He's not a loyal person & I now understand why everybody dumped him.
Jay sucks!
I hear this moron @billmaher said nasty things about me (hair etc—boring) on the terminated @jayleno show.
Stupid guy/bad ratings!
Jay Leno and his people are constantly calling me to go on his show.
My answer is always no because his show sucks.
They love my ratings!
Is Anthony Weiner a jerk or what!
President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE.
Amazingly, now he denies he said that!
The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement.
Tell Congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world.
Make America great again!
If you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the NY Times of the "rebels" executing prisoners, you would say forget the rebels!
While everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack Syria, maybe we should knock the hell out of Iran and their nuclear capabilities?
AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!
I have just lost my beautiful & elegant long time exec.
assistant  Norma Foerderer.
She passed away yesterday – a truly magnificent woman.
It will be interesting to see what happens to Eliot Spitzer if he loses the election for Comptroller to very capable @scottmstringer.
All former Bush administration officials should have zero standing on Syria.
Iraq was a waste of blood & treasure.
Russia is sending a fleet of ships to the Mediterranean.
Obama’s war in Syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict.
In January '12, 3 turbines were wrecked in rough weather ......
We should not attack Syria but if they make the stupid move to do so, the Arab League,whose members are laughing at us, should pay!
The terrorists in Syria are calling themselves REBELS and getting away with it because our leaders are so         completely stupid!
Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what, when and where to Congress about a Syrian attack.
Far too late!
We don't have the leadership, including the Generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone!
Cool it.
Really bad news just announced concerning jobs.
Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated.
Interest rates, therefore, to remain low.
I wonder how much our "leaders" have promised, or given, Russia in order for them to behave and not make the U.S. look even worse?
I am not angry at Russia (or China) because their leaders are far smarter than ours.
The historic $250M renovations at @TrumpDoral are moving on pace.
Once complete, @TrumpDoral will be South Florida’s premiere resort.
No surprise.
Many of the Syrian rebels are radical jihadi Islamists who are murdering Christians.
Why would we ever fight with them?
Obama is not a leader, he's just a campaigner!
When we have big disasters, no one comes to our aid or even suggests helping - but we are always expected to come to the aid of others!
If Syria was forced to use Obamacare they would self-destruct without a shot being fired.
Obama should sell them that idea!
Just watching NBC News where our potential attack is being detailed-the exact ships, the stealth bombers, the destinations-so ridiculous!
Syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas!
A polititian's war.
Former President Jimmy Carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst President in the history of the United States!
I'm a Republican but not a fan of the last George Bush-he also was a lousy President (Iraq etc.
).
In fact, he was so bad he gave us Obama!
Speaking of our very stupid war with Iraq, it is totally disintegrating and Iran (with Russia) will walk in and take it over (lots of oil)!
Isn't it intetesting that anybody who attacks President Obama is considered a racist by the real racists out there!
President Obama, do not attack Syria.
There is no upside and tremendous downside.
Save your "powder" for another (and more important) day!
My shirts, ties and suits are selling great @Macy's because they are the best and most stylish at a really reasonable price - thanks!
Do you notice that nobody is talking about the many scandals of the Obama administration anymore - The Teflon President!
Doing a commercial for @NFLONFOX- lots of fun!
The New York Giants are looking really bad so far tonight.
Does not get much worse than this!
Great comeback by Tom Brady-New England!
Tony Romo just made a great play-Giants are getting killed!
Also, great comeback by the New York Jets.
That game was over until a really dumb defensive play by Tampa.
Amazing.
Why are we fighting for the "rebels" that hate us-only to save face for Obama!
Don't attack Syria - an attack that will bring nothing but trouble for the U.S. Focus on making our country strong and great again!
Congratulations to @serenawilliams on her superb @usopen win.
She is terrific!
Now Obama has set red line 2 with demand that Assad hands over Syria’s chemical weapons or it will face an attack.
This week will mark the 1 year anniversary of the attack in Benghazi that left 4 Americans dead.
No answers!
Iraq has granted Iran full air rights to fly over and arm Syria.
What did America accomplish with the Iraq war?
And now Syria?!
Our economy is in trouble.
The unemployed are more likely to drop out of the workforce than find a job.
We need growth-- and now!
So much for ‘global warming.
Icahn, Kravis, Zell, Buffett have all used the bankrutcy law to their benefit.
Many of the top business people do.
Do you believe what is going on in Washington with respect to Syria - these people don't have a clue!
I'll be going to the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. today.
Will create one of world's great hotels.
Lots of jobs!
This George Zimmerman is really a mess - he really has to just disappear!
(He attacked his wife last night).
We deserve all the answers on Benghazi!
For all of my millions of followers, and at your request, I will be tweeting tonight during President Obama’s speech!
Obama and Kerry are bungling Syria by the hour.
They have set America’s deterrence & stature back by years.
Amateurs!
Want to take a quiz with me?
Assad will never give up his chemical weapons.
He has spent years and billions accumulating them.
This is all a ruse.
In order to stay competitive in your industry, it is imperative to keep up to date on all news.
A great commodity is information.
Danger-Weiner is a free man at 12:01AM.
He will be back sexting with a vengeance.
All women remain on alert.
The Russians are playing a very smart game.
In the meantime they are buying lots of time for Syria and making U.S. look foolish.
Dangerous!
This new Russian strategy guarantees victory for the Syrian government-and makes Obama and U.S. look hopelessly bad.
President in trouble!
Red line statement was a disaster for President Obama.
Will be covering President Obama's speech at 9.00 on Twitter-you are all so lucky!
Here we go!
Does he look sharp, smart and presidential-his hands keep hitting the podium, making a loud and distracting noise-microphone too sensitive.
Making his case in a nice and articulate manner.
Doesn't want to remove Assad - worries what comes next.
He is working hard and for that he must be given credit!
We will have to see what Russia's next move will be.
They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess!
Bottom line, I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin, a very dangerous lifeline at that!
Wow, Eliot Spitzer has lost - great news for New York City!
I fought hard against Spitzer and Weiner, and both lost.
For a while, when Spitzer was way up, it seemed that I was a lone voice!
Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spitzer.
Remember, in the beginning they said it couldn't be done!
Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman asked us for political contributions DURING his investigation of us,then sued for $40 million.
Dopey guy!
Lightweight Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will be next to lose.
The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedule-Putin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad!
Back to work for the President to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself.
The so-called rebels must be thoroughly confused!
Assad hit the jackpot!
Weiner is gone, Spitzer is gone - next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman.
Is he a crook?
Spitzer and Weiner lost, lightweight Eric Schneiderman will be next - he will be challenged in the PRIMARY.
He has done a really poor job!
I said that Eliot Spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls.
I fought him when others retreated out of fear.
NEVER GIVE UP!
Putin is having such a good time.
Our President is making him look like the genius of all geniuses.
Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems.
Forget Syria and make America great again!
God bless all the brave souls who perished 12 years ago today.
You will never be forgotten!
Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump, and myself in front of The Old Post Office, D.C. on Pennsylvania...
A year ago today a diplomat and 3 security operatives were abandoned by our government while they were under attack.
Never forget!
Many people have asked recently "when do you sleep"?
The answer is -- not much.
Why is oil at a record high?
OPEC & the oil speculators continue to rip us off.
Putin's letter is a masterpiece for Russia and a disaster for the U.S.
He is lecturing to our President.
Tina Brown could finally be over.
@thedailybeast is a total failure.
She just got fired, great!
At least @TheTinaBeast is consistent.
She takes over a magazine and it ends up in the gutter.
China, Russia and Iran are laughing at us.
We have weak leaders who are threatening our national security.
Dangerous times.
Now Assad is demanding that Obama stop supporting the rebels before he turns over his chemical weapons.
What a mess!
NO GAMES!
HOUSE @GOP MUST DEFUND OBAMACARE!
IF THEY DON’T, THEN THEY OWN IT!
@Yankees manager Joe Girardi is a gritty leader who stands up for his players.
Doing a great job!
Most people do not know what Presient Obama is going to do to save his legacy.
I do!
He's got to get back to basics.
We should stop talking, stay out of Syria and other countries that hate us, rebuild our own country and make it strong and great again-USA!
Prayers go out to the victims of the terrible fire in New Jersey.
Stay strong and remember it will soon get better.
I truly hope President Obama doesn't do something irrational and dangerous for our country in order to save face.
New York Fashion Week is really bad, and used to be so glamorous and exciting!
No stars, no fun-just boring.
They need serious help.
When I say I would end Obamacare, I would also come up with a plan that would be far better, much easier to understand, and cost less!
I can’t believe my friend Derek Jeter is out for whole season--injured day he left Trump World Tower.
Lucky bldg.
-- Move back fast!
Congratulations to @ehasselbeck on her successful first day as co-host of @foxandfriends!
Great to be in studio today for Elisabeth.
I predict that President Obama will at some point attack Iran in order to save face!
Bashar Assad is stronger today than he was before Obama threatened military action.
Obama really bungled this.
Michigan has made great progress under Snyder-Calley.
@MIGOP is out early energizing the grassroots.
Keep it up!
Only 15 days until ObamaCare is implemented.
Congress must waive the monstrosity for regular Americans.
Why should they be punished?
I am proud to announce our newest project, Trump Tower Mumbai.
Together with the Lodha Group, it will be incredible!
The Navy Yard shooting is a horrible disaster.
If we don't clean up OUR COUNTRY of the garbage soon, we are just going to do a death spiral!
American Exceptionalism and the Navy Yard shooting do not go hand in hand.
The Costa Concordia shipwreck is a MONUMENT TO STUPIDITY but the uprighting of the ship is a MONUMENT TO GENIUS!
@RNC leadership should not be afraid of a government shutdown.
They should be afraid of not defunding ObamaCare.
Video of my day at The Old Post Office- soon to be the most fabulous hotel!
Everyone should calm down.
@BenAffleck is going to do a great job as Batman.
Just returned from Trump Doral in Miami.
Massive construction job.
When completed will be the best resort in U.S. Blue Monster is amazing!
Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman sued school with a 98% approval rating while billions in corruption goes unpunished.
A total crook?
Why is lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman allowed to ask for campaign contributions from my people during settlement negotiations?
Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman is perhaps the most incompetent and least respected A.G. in the U.S.
He is a total joke!
I cannot believe that Apple didn't come out with a larger screen IPhone.
Samsung is stealing their business.
Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman meets with President Obama (who he told me "sucks" as a president), and quickly files a suit against me!
Lightweight Schneiderman's suit was filed on a Saturday (unheard of) against a school with a 98% approval rating right after Obama meeting.
My comments on a larger screen iPhone were in addition to existing unit, not a replacement.
Screen should be 10% larger than Samsung.
As a stockholder in Apple, they should get on with a larger screen iPhone as a supplement—immediately..
@MileyCyrus – don’t worry about Liam.
You can do much better and you have plenty of time—remain strong!
President Obama seems so fawning and desperate to make a deal with Iran that lots of bad results can occur.
Be cool and be careful!
President Obama must remember that the worst thing you can do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.
Be cool, move slowly - and think!
Move slowly, carefully --- and then strike like the fastest animal on the planet!
Congratulations to @SpeakerBoehner on standing strong and tying government shutdown to defunding ObamaCare.
Americans by & large hate ObamaCare.
They see Obama lied to get it passed.
They see big business & gov’t got waivers.
Defund!
If you include people who have left the work force, unemployment rate is 15%.
Labor participation rate is lowest in 70 yrs.
Welcome to the new reality.
An important part of my (or anybody's) success is the ability to judge people.
I believe that @MileyCyrus is a really good person.
Republicans must unite to defund Obamacare - it will drive our country into oblivion and, by the way, the healthcare is no good anyway!
Big things going on today at Trump National-Westchester!
Referees are destroying the enjoyment of NFL games.
Slowing down the fun.
Big shots.
Jets game is ridiculous!
Is it the Neil Patrick Harris show or the Emmy Awards?
How was he ever put in this position to start with?
CRAZY!
The Emmys are sooooo boring!
Terrible show.
I'm going to watch football!
I already know the winners.
Good night.
Congratulations to @IvankaTrump on being named @FoxNewsSunday Power Player of the Week.
Ivanka is doing a great job w/ DC Post Office.
Mariano Rivera is greatest closer of all time.
A leader in the club house & an exceptional man.
One of the best @Yankees in history.
Americans nationwide have their premiums double and work hours decreased.
@GOP must do the right thing, stand strong & defund!
The Democrats in Congress don’t want ObamaCare for themselves or big businesses.
So why are they forcing it on the American people?
Obama’s coal regulations will destroy the coal industry, put Americans out of work, raise electricity prices & lead to blackouts.
Huma should dump the sicko Weiner.
He is a calamity that is bringing her down with him.
I am a defender of @MileyCyrus, who I think is a good person (and not because she stays at my hotels), but last night's outfit must go!
Congrats to Team USA & Capt.
@AllenWronowski for retaining the PGA Cup!
Well done and well deserved!
Obama told the UN that “the world is more stable than it was 5 years ago”.
Is he delusional?
Obama promised premiums would lower $2,500/yr for family of 4.
Less than one week away from implementation, ObamaCare’s small business exchanges are not ready!
It’s a shame the ruling class of Republicans don’t attack Obama and the Democrats the way they hit Senators Cruz & Lee.
If Justice Roberts had made the correct decision on ObamaCare, our country would not be in turmoil right now!
Can you believe the head of Iran refused to meet with our great President?
—Zero respect!
Remember what I previously said--Obama will someday attack Iran in order to show how tough he is.
Obama wanted to meet with the Iranian president, yet the Iranians denied the request.
So much for Hope & Change.
If ObamaCare is so amazing, then why is Obama delaying significant parts of the bill before the election?
In real estate, all locations can be enhanced through good marketing.
Be smart!
Happy belated birthday wishes to @BarbaraJWalters.
Barbara is terrific!
Both Obama administration and House leadership staffs are exempt from ObamaCare.
Why not the American people?
DEFUND!
The big golf course project on the water by the Whitestone Bridge in NYC that has been under construction for many years now complete-GREAT!
To be called Trump Links at Ferry Point, course will be GREAT and, over the years, hold many tournaments and major championships-$'s to NYC.
Credit the Bloomberg administration for having the foresight and courage to get this decades old project finished - will be BIG for NY.
Yes, this is a large scale version of when I built and saved the ice skating rink in Central Park (which all should go to).
Great course!
I am so happy that I was able to do something really good for the Bronx - and lots of jobs!
You have to believe in what you want.
Keep your focus, keep your momentum--and remain patient and persistent.
Our country needs leadership now.
There is total dysfunction in Washington.
On Monday, ObamaCare kicks in with all goodies of 300% increased premiums, higher taxes and part-time replacement employees.
Don’t believe the manipulated job numbers.
Walmart has just cut orders with suppliers because of rising inventory.
Re negotiation: Know exactly what you want and keep it to yourself.
Think about what the other side wants and where they're coming from.
Iran is toying with our president - buying time and laughing at the stupidity of our leadership.
Syria, and now this!
What's next?
Our country and it's leadership has to be so careful and so smart - these are treacherous times, like no other.
The world is a crazy place!
Obamacare is far toooo expensive, far toooo complicated (thousands of pages) and, most importantly, doesn't work.
WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER!
No one wants the government to shut down, but if ObamaCare is fully implemented then our country will eventually shutdown anyway!
The commodity market is extremely fragile.
Be wary of investing right now.
The futures are way too dependent on the Fed.
Business is an art in itself, and powerful negotiation skills are one of the techniques necessary to facilitate success.
Since stop & frisk was struck down, gun shootings & victims have spiked-- while gun seizures have decreased.
Remember that in 2006 then Senator Obama voted NOT TO INCREASE THE DEBT CEILING.
Now he acts in disbelief as others plan to do the same!
The Republicans can absolutely win if they stick together-but they are NOT sticking together.
Sen.
McCain just said "we can't win".
Very bad!
Achievers move forward at all times.
Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
Obama & the Democrats want this shutdown.
They think it helps their electoral prospects for 2014.
Don’t believe!
Obama has not passed a single budget in 4 years.
Democrats don’t even vote them in Congress.
He has failed to lead!
It was an honor to be @GretchenCarlson's inaugural guest on her new show ‘The Real Story.
’ Gretchen will be a big success!
Remember when Obama promised “you can keep your health care plan?
” Not in these 10 states.
There have been 17 shutdowns since 1976, 14 under Reagan and Bush with Democrat Congresses who wanted more spending.
Can you imagine, with all of the talk about ObamaCare, technical breakdowns made it a disastrous day.
Our government is badly broken!
Wow, three top MICROSOFT investors want Bill Gates out as Chairman.
Do not like job he is doing!
New York State's lightweight A.G. is driving business & jobs out of N.Y. Look into his past-he shouldn't even be allowed to hold office!
Sorry banks, when we accused lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman of not going after banks, he started going after banks—but years too late!
The ObamaCare disaster is in full swing.
Websites are down, people can’t sign up and elderly can’t understand the lingo.
Democrats refused to vote down their ObamaCare subsidy.
Young entrepreneurs across the US are trying to make deals & build businesses daily.
A-Rod’s appeal will go nowhere.
He will get a long suspension.
Good for the @Yankees.
And sends strong message to @MLB players.
Stocks rose yesterday during the first day of government shutdown.
Markets like being left alone for a day.
The most elite private club in the world, Mar-a-Lago, is Palm Beach’s legendary landmark.
My friend Larry King @kingsthings asked me to do an interview with him—he was always great to me—& I agreed.
Watch tonight 9 PM on RTV.
Angela Merkel is doing a fantastic job as the Chancellor of Germany.
Youth unemployment is at a record low & she has a budget surplus.
‘Moderate’ Repubs plotting against @GOP strategy have short term memories.
Tea Party gave them majority in House & primaries aren't fun.
Oil has been over $33/gallon for 34 months.
A new record.
And now with Obama’s war on coal, American families will be hit even harder.
Many Red-State Democrats sticking with Obama on deficit spending on the ObamaCare monstrosity will be defeated in 2014.
Obama and the Democrats have no respect for WWII vets trying to get into the memorial.
Obama administration had 4 years to prepare for the ObamaCare rollout.
And of course they failed miserably.
Great ruling on wind farm in Scotland—very smart judge!
Front page article.
Congrats to people of Scotland on the Judge’s ruling concerning bird killing, land destroying, environmentally disastrous windmills.
Just read @marklevinshow’s bestseller book—really great!
Total misnomer to call ObamaCare ‘The Affordable Care Act.
’ Affordable for whom besides big businesses & Congress w/their exemptions?
Obama has unilaterally & unconstitutionally drawn 4 ObamaCare exemptions for his friends.
Congrats to @nbc on the success of the new smash show @NBCBlacklist.
Fantastic suspense.
Great acting.
Must see TV!
Must read editorial today about lightweight New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.
Is he a crook?
When will lightweight hack Attorney General be investigated for his repeated prosecutorial misconduct?
While the Pres.
of Iran tweets sweet nothings to Obama he forbids the Iranians to use twitter.
Very revealing.
The Obama Administration has a very important duty to provide a budget - and then negotiate!
OUR COUNTRY is a laughingstock!
Standing strong for his people, @GovWalker is ignoring the Feds and keeping all Wisconsin parks open.
Great!
Government is shut down yet Obama is now harassing the privately owned @Redskins to change its name.
He needs to focus on his job!
Obama is tougher on WWII vets wanting to visit a DC memorial than Iran.
He needs to show respect to our vets and not play games.
Room for cuts.
With the debt limit approaching, @GOP has even more leverage.
If they stay united and on message they can win.
My sense is that people are far angrier at the President than they are at Congress re the shutdown—an interesting turn!
President should not be telling the Washington Redskins to change their name-our country has far bigger problems!
President Obama wants to change the name of the "White House" because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct!
Expect the best from people.
They will rise to the challenge and  it's important to inspire confidence.
If you are steadfast in your efforts and self respect, critics will be harmless.
Keep your focus!
@GOP has leverage.
Must stay united & on message.
Had a great time on @gretawire’s inaugural 7PM show.
Congrats to Greta  on the new spot!
Did you ever think our country would  become an economic basket case?
So much for Hope & Change.
In my opinion, one of the worst utility companies in the country is Florida Power and Light.
Florida Power & Light has disgusting rotting utility poles outside Doral in Miami.
They should put in new ones or will be sued.
I'm just so tired of listening to the same old rhetoric and words, day after day, from our President.
It's time to stop talking-WORK!
With President Obama it's all talk and no action.
Our country is in desperate need of smart and decisive leadership before it is too late!
It is outrageous and disgusting that families of U.S. MILITARY personnel killed in action will not be given money for burials.
SAD!
If the U.S. Government doesn't give the money necessary for the burials of our military personnel, I will.
The U.S. under Obama's leadership!
Entrepreneurs who develop their Midas Touch do not work for money.
They work to create or acquire assets.
Focus on assets.
I pay millions of $’s a year to Florida Power & Light & they can’t give us what we want.
Maybe a major class action suit against them?
Re Florida Power & Light—Most important is safety but they have to also cater to aesthetics & not ruin the beauty of Florida.
Obama can open the Mall for illegals to protest our country yet he continues to barricade WWII memorial.
That’s an absolute disgrace.
Obama’s job approval is at 37%, a record low.
@GOP & @SpeakerBoehner have the leverage & momentum.
Delay ObamaCare for all Americans!
Obama is the most profligate deficit & debt spender in our nation’s history.
Obama has called @GOP terrorists during this showdown.
It’s a shame he really doesn’t think it because then he would meet all @GOP demands.
If you don’t treat yourself like royalty, no one else will.
I’ll be doing @piersmorgan show tonight on CNN at 9 PM.
Will be very  interesting.
(I hope!
I will be on @piersmorganlive tonight at 9PM.
Jack Welch thinks Sam Palmisano, retired CEO of IBM, should be the next CEO of MICROSOFT.
Interesting!
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is pushing for the Moreland Commission to be disbanded immediately—because he is being looked at!
I wouldn’t use @Richard_Meier to design a doghouse, let alone a house or building!
Why is Douglas Durst allowed to use the World Trade Center to get out of a lease with Conde Nast?
Personally, I think Douglas Durst’s brother got screwed by Douglas—no wonder he’s angry!
Weekly jobless claims soared to 21.
Congrats to Jim Lipton and Inside the Actors Studio for winning the Emmy Award for the 250th Episode.
I was honored to appear in it.
How do you spend over $635M on websites and they don't work?
I know a great deal about websites etc.
Somebody got rich building the ObamaCare website which doesn't even come close to working - where has the money gone?
As an addition, Apple must go to a larger screen now--asap!
They're losing their standing in the market!
My beautiful daughter Ivanka just had a healthy baby boy.
Jared and Ivanka are very proud!
Thanks to all for the wonderful congratulation sent to me on the birth of Ivanka's little boy - so nice!
Republicans seem intent on negotiating against themselves.
Many senior Senators are doing Obama’s bidding.
Can’t win this way.
Will be cutting ribbon at           10 A.M. with Mayor Bloomberg and Jack Nicklaus for the opening of TRUMP LINKS at FERRY POINT.
Trump Links will be a great championship golf course that will host many major tournaments and bring tremendous $'s & prestige to N.Y.C.!
Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point will host many major championships over the years.
Great thing for NYC—congratulations to all!
Just left Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point.
Ribbon cutting w/@MayorBloomberg & @jacknicklaus was spectacular.
Lots of people & jobs!
@TrumpLasVegas was just rated “Best Room Service” in LV by The Daily Meal.
Congrats to my Las Vegas staff!
What a great day it was yesterday showing the public Trump Links at Ferry Point.
I took over a disaster and made it GREAT!
Good job to all!
I'm glad that Mark Cuban won the ridiculous case with the    S.E.C.  It never should have been brought in the first place!
Remember, if you don't pat yourself on the back, nobody else will.
Take credit for your successes and don't let others forget!!!!!!
@BMP_Music_Event  Read 'Midas Touch' -- great book for entrepreneurs.
Good luck!
Entrepreneurship is engine of American success.
Obama administration is killing American industrial renaissance by stopping drilling and fracking.
Terrible for economy.
Apple must make the IPhone screen bigger.
Losing major market share.
A winning attitude will put everything in perspective.
Keep negative thoughts and people where they belong--out of the big picture.
Gain and use information to your advantage--see every day as an opportunity to learn.
I'm on the David Letterman @LateShow tonight--looking forward to it.
Thanks for all of the great support but I just don't see myself wanting to run for Governor of New York - I have something else in mind!
By the way, New York State MUST LOWER TAXES (and fast) and must start going after all of the "energy" that lies just below our feet (now)!
The contract to build the ObamaCare website was given to a CANADIAN company for $55, 744, 081.
I build beautiful websites with very smart and imaginative people for almost NOTHING.
ObamaCare website fiasco was a SINGLE bid to a Canadian company - terrible!
The 2013 MISS UNIVERSE® Pageant will take place in Russia for the very first time in the 62 year history of the contest.
This will be one of the biggest and most beautiful Miss Universe events ever.
Honored to be attending Rev.
@BillyGraham’s 95th birthday.
His life & work has brought hope & faith to millions worldwide.
Can you imagine a Canadian company developing our website?
Terrible way to put Americans back to work.
Our country is being run by total amateurs.
Let’s just call it “amateur hour”.
I love watching the dishonest writers @NYMag suffer the magazine’s failure.
No surprise Saudis turned down spot on UN Security Council.
They don’t want  responsibility.
Just have us do their heavy lifting.
Wow, China's growth accelerated 7.8% in third quarter.
Canadians kicked out the firm that the U.S. paid all that money to for the failed website.
How stupid are our "leaders"?
This is a scandal!
No wonder @NYMag is doing so poorly, with an idiot Sr. Editor like @DanAmira, it will only get worse!
I hope everyone that read @DanAmira's reprehensible statement will cancel their subscription to @NYMag in protest.
Let me know.
Secy.
Sebelius, who was responsible for the horrendous ObamaCare rollout, should resign or be fired.
Just like its website, ObamaCare is a disaster.
Maybe all those who are fighting it are wasting their time-it will fail on its own!
THE ROLLOUT OF OBAMACARE IS A TOTAL DISASTER AND AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR COUNTRY.
THE WORLD IS WATCHING AND LAUGHING.
$635,000,000 WEBSITE!
Why doesn't President Obama just get the people from Google to fix the failed   website.
In fact, why didn't he use them in the first place!
I would bet that we have many great American technology companies that would build and fix the pathetic ObamaCare website for ZERO dollars!
Doing Fox and Friends in two minutes!
Trump Int’l Hotel & Tower Chicago is one of very few hotels in No.
America w/ a 5 Star, 5 Diamond Hotel & a 5 Star, 5 Diamond Restaurant....
@VanityFair magazine is doing so poorly that they make even @NYMag look good.
Graydon Carter should’ve been fired a long time ago.
Where’s the global warming?
Doing an interview with @SteveDeaceShow.
Discussing the ObamaCare  web disaster.
On November 9th @MissUniverse comes to Moscow!
Hosted by the wonderful duo of @OfficialMelB & @ThomasARoberts in Crocus City Hall!
Message to Edward Snowden, you’re banned from @MissUniverse.
Unless you want me to take you back home to face justice!
Looking forward to receiving the T. Boone Pickens Entrepreneur Award at tomorrow’s @AmSpec Robert L. Bartley Gala dinner.
Have time to waste?
Go to the ObamaCare website.
If you want to succeed, keep your edge.
Staying on top of all new developments in your sector = major advantage that pays dividends.
Breaking news - The Washington Redskins have just announced that they will be removing the name Washington from their name!
Honestly, whether you're for or against ObamaCare, the 635 million dollar website fiasco is bad for the U.S.
It makes us look totally inept!
Why doesn't President Obama call upon the NSA to fix the badly broken website-then they could spy on all of the many cheaters & arrest them!
Where’s the accountability for the $635M website fiasco in the Obama administration?
I’ll soon be leaving for Washington where @AmSpec will give me the T. Boone Pickens Entrepreneur Award.
Very exciting!
If the Saudis are so concerned about Syria then they should go in themselves.
Stop telling us to do their dirty work.
It was just determined that the woman who passed out at Obama’s press conference had just seen what her new premiums would be!
You've got something unique to offer.
Find out what it is.
Ask yourself: What can I provide that does not yet exist?
Good advice from my father, Fred C. Trump: "Know everything you can about what you're doing".
Good advice from my mother, Mary MacLeod Trump: “Trust in God and be true to  yourself”.
Great evening with the @AmSpec & the T. Boone Pickens Entrepreneur Award.
Amazing crowd—thank you!
Bob Tyrrell @AmSpec—Thank you--and also for the great work you do.
Jeffrey Lord @AmSpec—Thank you for the presentation—terrific job!
@BoonePickens  Thank you for the T. Boone Pickens Entrepreneur Award—a great honor for me from a fantastic man.
Great meeting @GarySinise at @AmSpec dinner.
Besides his great acting, Gary does tremendous work for vets through his foundation.
When a complex website is broken the best thing to do is blow it up and start all over again-then sue the culprits and use the proper team!
First Titantic sunk on its maiden voyage.
Next the Hindenburg explodes on its first flight to America.
Now we suffer the ObamaCare rollout!
Can you imagine the anger and disgust when the heads of other countries found out that their cell phones were being tapped by NSA.
With the $635 million dollar website fiasco, getting caught tapping phones of WORLD LEADERS and so much more, U.S. is looking really stupid!
At this point the legacy of the Obama Administration will be, sadly, that of THE GANG THAT COULDN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT - what a pathetic mess!
Isn't it amazing that the U.S. and NSA can listen to the highly protected phone conversations of world leaders but can't get O's records!
I must say that some of these college football games are great tonight-very exciting-I wish I had more time to watch!
Good night everyone - sleep well and tomorrow have many victories!
President Obama should bring Secretaty Sebelius into his office, look right into her beautiful blue eyes and say,with emotion, YOU'RE FIRED!
The new line of Trump ties, shirts and cufflinks are out at Macy's and are really beautiful at a really reasonable.
price.
Go check them out!
Will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00.
Will be discussing the disgusting and wasteful $635 million website rollout and more!
Yesterday was Matt Drudge's birthday --Happy Birthday @DRUDGE--and great job!
Time for Sebelius to be fired.
I don’t know why our allies are so surprised Obama is tapping their phones?
Nothing changes!
Sebelius didn't test $635M (probably $1B) ObamaCare website until “a couple of days leading up to the launch”.
Contractors can blame Obama admin all day for their $600M failure but both parties are at fault--pay taxpayers back.
Iraq is being ravaged by Al Qaeda.
Like your current health care plan?
Too bad, you’re going to lose it under ObamaCare.
Hope, Change & a  300% Increase in Your Premium.
Does anybody really think that President Obama didn't know about our spying on the leaders of allies around the world - not possible!
There are so many blatant lies coming out of the ADMINISTRATION - healthcare, spying, NSA, IRS, brutally killed Americans -WILL IT EVER END?
I just don't know why some of these NFL teams with lousy quarterbacks don't give Tim Tebow a chance - what do they have to lose?
Maybe if Obama knew too much about the spying it would be worse than knowing nothing - but either way it is just another disaster!
Great victory for people of Blackdog, Scotland.
They defeated substation, stopping inefficient & ugly wind turbines.
When will @AlexSalmond realize that he's destroying Scotland--the most beautiful countryside in the world w/ his stupid wind turbines?
@AlexSalmond suffered a huge defeat by the people of Blackdog.
Communities all over Scotland are fighting this loser..
@AlexSalmond –the man who let terrorist (Pan Am Flight 103) al-Megrahi  go, lost another battle over ugly wind turbines in Blackdog..
@AlexSalmond  of Scotland may be the dumbest leader of the free world.
I can’t imagine that anyone wants him in office.
Fact – all the countries complaining about us spying on them spy on us.
They just don't get caught--stupid!
Won’t be a buyer’s market for long.
If you can, purchase a home but remember, I told you this three years ago.
I hear @billmaher really bombed in Springfield--people were leaving show way early--stupid guy!
A great victory in Scotland ...
Congrats to @rushlimbaugh on the release of his new book “Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims”.
Four brave Americans died in Benghazi.
Administration is still covering up the truth.
We deserve to know the full truth.
China just called.
They want to lend Obama another $1B for the ObamaCare web site.
How come Snowden and ObamaCare have access to all records and information but don't have even the smallest tidbits on President Obama?
Looks like a very good World Series game!
Isn't the WORLD tired of hearing President Obama say he knew nothing about anything-time to take responsibility for all of your mistakes!
Both of our New York hotels are on the Top Ten list of the most luxurious hotels in NYC....
@TrumpPanama is Panama City’s premiere hotel.
Congratulations to Boston on the @RedSox World Series victory.
Earned and deserved.
It’s Thursday.
@billmaher is still a very dumb guy--just look at his past.
So we can spy on our ally’s leaders but can’t water board terrorists?
The bus driver who saved the woman from jumping off the bridge was really cool, great guy.
I'm going to send him $10, 000-he deserves it!
Millions losing healthcare plans despite President Obama's promise that this WOULD NOT HAPPEN!
Will be on Fox & Friends in five minutes - enjoy and good morning!
Everyone is telling me that @EliotSpitzer is going to run against lightweight @AGSchneiderman--Spitzer would win!
Beauty arrives to Moscow’s Crocus City Hall this 11.9.!
Hope & Change.
The ObamaCare website will cost over $1.5B when all is said and done.
Crazy!
Wow, just watching the news.
ObamaCare and the website are TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.
Costs are through the roof.
This could be ruinous to U.S.!
Lies and incompetence - the two words that are most closely associated with ObamaCare!
I would gain a whole new respect for President Obama if he would say, "look, we made a big mistake, sorry"!
No more lies or deception.
The @AmSpec article, "Shakedown Schneiderman" about NY State lightweight @AGSchneiderman is amazing.
Sen.
Hitting at home.
Democrat Sen.
Revisionist history.
Now Obama claims he never told us that everyone could keep their healthcare plans.
Crazy!
Can you believe that the builder of the failed ObamaCare website was just given a new government contract - how stupid is that - CLUELESS!!!
The truth is that we could have much better healthcare in our country at a much more affordable price - everyone in U.S. would benefit!
Our NOBEL PRIZE FOR PEACE president said "I'm really good at killing people" according to just out book Double Down.
Can Oslo retract prize?
With terrific Steve Wynn at dinner last night.
Success tip: See yourself as victorious.
This will focus you in the right direction.
Apply your skills and talent--and be tenacious.
Job tip: If you were the employer, what kind of person would you most desire as an employee?
Be that person.
Use your intelligence and your education to execute what your imagination presents to you.
This is one step to becoming an entrepreneur.
Brian @kilmeade wrote a wonderful book called "George Washington's Secret Six" that is truly worth reading.
When Obama tried to tweak his previous statement on ObamaCare he made it an even greater lie-even the Senate Democrats are angry with him!
Just sit back and watch, ObamaCare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards.
The website is the best part of this mess!
She is so sad and pathetic that I almost feel sorry for Sec.
Sebelius.
She has done great harm to many people and must be fired.
Incompetent!
Put Kathleen Sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say, YOU'RE FIRED!
Let her go home to her family and rest.
BRING IN TOP FLIGHT PEOPLE!
Prediction: The disaster known as ObamaCare will only get worse and Republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years!
A level will be reached where ObamaCare will be so out of control, expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship.
If Democrats do not start opposing ObamaCare, and fast, Republicans will have a massive victory in 2014 - far greater than any predictions!
I will be going to Asheville, North Carolina, tonight for the 95th birthday party of the GREAT Billy Graham - such a wonderful man!
It’s that time of the year.
@TrumpRink in Central Park is now open--best rink in the world.
Had dinner this week at @MEGUNYC (at Trump World Tower) opposite the United Nations—fantastic food!
Looking forward to attending the GREAT Rev.
@BillyGraham’s birthday party tonight--there's nobody like him!
Congratulations to the $1B ObamaCare website on enrolling FOUR in Delaware.
At least 3.5M fellow Americans are going to lose their healthcare plans because of ObamaCare.
Defund then repeal!
We still have not learned the full truth on Benghazi.
Four Americans were killed.
Congress must act!
Upstate New York needs jobs.
Frack Now & Frack Fast!
Pay off NY State debt.
Success tip: Be ready for problems, and be patient--there are very few cases of instant gratification.
Being successful requires nothing less than 100% of your concentrated effort.
Be totally focused.
Leadership: Whatever happens, you're responsible.
If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.
I'm in Moscow for Miss Universe tonight - picking a winner is very hard, they are all winners.
Total sellout of arena.
Big night in Russia!
I was just given a great tour of Moscow - fantastic, hard working people.
CITY IS REALLY ENERGIZED!
The World will be watching tonight!
I just got back from Russia-learned lots & lots.
Moscow is a very interesting and amazing place!
U.S. MUST BE VERY SMART AND VERY STRATEGIC.
I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.
Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!
If we could force Russia, China and other competitors to use ObamaCare, we would be able to instantly destroy their great economic success!
Drew Brees is having a great game - a fantastic quarterback and really good guy!
If Justice Roberts had done the right thing and voted against ObamaCare, our country would be in a lot better shape right now!
The Republicans must be patient and smart - ObamaCare could sweep them into office in far greater numbers than anyone ever thought possible!
While I was in Moscow I see that President Obsma apologized for his lie, I mean statement, on ObamaCare!
Don't worry, when our country starts hurting bad enough from all of the mistakes that are being made, we will start doing the right things.
WE WILL ONLY BE THE LAND OF THE FREE AS LONG AS WE ARE HOME OF THE BRAVE!
Happy Veterans Day to ALL, in particular to the haters and losers who have no idea how lucky they are!!!
@IamStevenT gave one of the greatest endings to a show ever @MissUniverse.
Standing ovation!
Miss USA pageant had a 4 to 1 vote in favor, but it won't be in Miami Doral in 2014-- Mayor Boria voted against it.
I want total support!
Everyone should watch the documentary ‘Windfall’ on @netflix.
See an upstate NY town ruined by environmentalists & windfarms.
ObamaCare is one of the worst political disasters of all time - 4,992,343 AMERICANS LOSING COVERAGE, LESS THAN 50,OOO NEW SIGNUPS.
President Obama is under pressure from Democrats to undo his lie on ObamaCare.
His problem is that such a move would end ObamaCare.
ObamaCare is on LIFE SUPPORT - it will soon be DEAD ON ARRIVAL - A bad concept that was imcompetently administered!
No matter how far down a path you go, if it's the wrong path, turn around and go back home - before it is too late.
Can you believe it—the model who mysteriously disappeared from the ObamaCare website is not a US citizen—she’s from Colombia.
The same people that built the ObamaCare website used, as the face of the website, someone who is not a US citizen.
Incompetent.
ICYMI-- "@MELANIATRUMP                Reading newspapers and see...
In a new poll a majority of people felt  the president "knowingly lied" about health care pledge.
Who are the fools who don't think he lied?
President Obama is the best thing that ever happened to Jimmy Carter!
Breaking news--negotiations with Iranians broke down because Obama insisted that they use ObamaCare.
More dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in ObamaCare.
Congratulations America!
@MissUniverse visited my office- tall and beautiful!
The cast has been largely selected for next year's Celebrity Apprentice.
Wait 'till you hear the names-AMAZING!
Did President Obama have a rough day yesterday, or what?
He has got to start telling the truth - NO MORE LIES OR DECEPTION!
The only deal the Republicans should accept is a complete repeal of ObamaCare.
You have them on the run - don't fold - go for it!
Rumor has it Apple is going to release iPhones with bigger screens.
That's good news.
Again, more dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in ObamaCare.
Congratulations America!
Why don't they FIGHT?
No wonder they keep getting sued.
The real J.P.Morgan is spinning in his grave at the ridiculous settlements the bank is making to settle disputes.
I wonder what the late, great Vince Lombardi would say about the Rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled?
I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming?
Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare.
How did the NCAA, which is weak and becoming irrelevant, extract such a big & reputation shattering settlement from Penn State.
Others zero!
I will be going to Trump National Doral in Miami early today to check on the construction of the hotel and the new Blue Monster.
AMAZING!
The polls have shown that DEAD PEOPLE voted for President Obama overwhelmingly and without hesitation - he must be doing something right!
President Obama played golf yesterday???
Our heartfelt prayers go out to our fellow Americans suffering from the storms & tornadoes.
I took some heat a long time ago when I said that George Zimmerman was a sicko and bad news.
I know people and this guy is no good-trouble!
Go to work today, be smart, think positively and WIN!
Congratulations to @MariaBartiromo on her big move to @FoxBusiness.
She is a total winner!
Last October on @meetthepress, @chucktodd attacked @jack_welch and I for saying Obama cooked the job number.
Will he apologize?
Guess who is talking to @MissUniverse at @TrumpTowerNY?
Not terrible hair!
Priorities.
Jamie Dimon just gave away $13B to government in settlement.
Terrible move & bad precedent.
Could have done much better by fighting.
Broken promises.
A broken billion dollar website.
ObamaCare can’t be fixed.
Repeal!
The next ObamaCare disaster will be doctors being dropped from plans.
ALWAYS BORROW MONEY FROM A PESSIMIST BECAUSE HE WILL NEVER EXPECT IT TO BE PAID BACK!
Work is fun, deals are fun, life is fun - but love of a great family makes it all come together.
Go out there and make your family proud.
Afghanistan leaders want the U.S. to keep 20, 000 troops there for many more years, fully paid for by the U.S., but first they want apology.
Emin from Russia--a very talented guy.
All proceeds go to help the Philippines.
Congratulations to @MikeTyson on the success of his new book "Undisputed Truth" & @HBO special--and thanks for the nice words, Mike.
$1B down another $1B to go.
ObamaCare website is 40% unfinished.
This is beyond pathetic.
When Warren Buffett & others play w/ bankruptcy, nobody cares—when Trump plays the game, it becomes a big deal!
Do not allow our very stupid leaders to sign a deal that keeps us in Afghanistan through 2024-with all costs by U.S.A.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT!
Today will be a great day at work - have only one word in mind, VICTORY!
Florida Power & Light did a fantastic job of providing service & energy during the big storm in Palm Beach.
We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan.
Their government has zero appreciation.
Let's get out!
Host of the 2017 U.S. Women's Open, Trump Bedminster has been rated one of America's best golf courses.
Emails prove WH knew ObamaCare website wouldn't work in October -- why didn't they delay the launch?
Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth.
We better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns!
If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)!
Weak newscasters are asking "is there a racial component to knockout attacks"?
Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse!
For all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack, please remember the late, great Charles Bronson-no more crime!
If JP Morgan took their case through the courts for 15 years, nobody would be suing them—easy target.
Hypocrite.
Since the Democrats decided to kill the filibuster, they now own it.
Republicans should keep the new rule when they're in the majority.
Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule.
Harry Reid & Obama killed it yesterday.
Rule was in effect for over 200 years.
Republicans have the right approach to ObamaCare – let it fail.
Free market solutions will be embraced by Americans in 2016.
It’s Friday.
How many millions has the White House wasted on the ObamaCare website today?
Young entrepreneurs – keep positive.
Don’t let the ObamaCare disaster stop your endeavors.
There are great opportunities out there.
We are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the Iran nuclear talks.
Strengthen sanctions until GREAT deal is made!
The scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head!
Get smart on knockout assaults and crime - we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter-and crime would end FAST!
Snow and ice, freezing weather, in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma - what the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING?
The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare!
They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working!
What a rotten deal we made with Iran.
We get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity).
They get everything, including delay and big cash!
How far has the United States gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with Iran.
Read THE ART OF THE DEAL!
I do not understand how so many of my Jewish friends backed Obama in the last election.
I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.
Will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence, of which our "leaders" have plenty!
How much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent     leader - ObamaCare, Iran, Syria, bads deals.
We had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with Iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap.
WHY?
Tom Brady has done a great job tonight-amazing New England comeback.
Good game- not over yet!
Tom Brady is a good friend of mine, a great player, a great guy and a total winner!
Fantastic comeback win-this is what our country needs!
John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran.
I know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but isn't it about time we start, right now.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) - TRUMP: THE ART OF THE DEAL.
Go get it, and others, Washington - you really can do better!
After settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars, J.P.Morgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine-why did they settle then-DUMB!
Don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities--keep your focus intact, and focus on the positives.
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort.
You're in charge.
Everything starts with you.
Who would  you rather have negotiating with Iran--President Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford?
My money is on Ford.
Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes.
Just think about that.
Why didn't Obama, as part of the negotiation, free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini?
Just got home, watching the news, and every story is bad about the U.S. Someday we will return to being great again, but we need leadership!
Don't worry, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE GREAT AGAIN!
New poll, WOW-53% say President Obama is not honest & trustworthy.
What took them so long.
President Obama is finally getting hammered, even by his most loyal supporters and the press-I guess they can only take so much!
I will be in Palm Beach, Jupiter, and Miami today checking on big construction projects.
Vision remains vision until you focus, do the work, and bring it down to earth where it will do some good.
Wind Power Company Fined $1 Million for Killing Birds.
Golden eagles among victims...
In Vegas?
I can't believe no one has been fired over the ObamaCare website fiasco!
When do we sue the company-- for billions-- that robbed us in creating the hapless ObamaCare website?
We enjoy hosting tourists in @TrumpTowerNY.
They come from all over the world to see the Atrium, a NYC landmark.
Wind Power Company Fined $1 Million for Killing Birds.
Golden eagles among victims...
How does Obama rationalize giving Iran $8B in sanction relief when a Christian pastor is being tortured in an Iranian prison?
Look great for Thanksgiving.
Set the example.
You can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example.
Look at the solution, not the problem.
Learn to focus on what will give results.
President Obama said, over and over again, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, PERIOD!
This turned out to be a total lie-90 mill.
Reigning @ApprenticeNBC Champion @TraceAdkins does great work with @wwpinc.
War on the families.
The $1B failed website is the tip of the iceberg on the ObamaCare.
Over 90 million estimated will lose their plans next year.
Make sure to enjoy your time with your family during the holiday.
It is a special time.
Love and appreciate your family.
Tell Iran to let our Christian Pastor go--and I mean right now.
If they don't, there will be hell to pay.
Happy Thanksgiving to all--even the haters and losers!
US froze $8B in Iranian assets during ’79 Hostage Crisis.
Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed.
Don't do it!
Why doesn't President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie, announce that ObamaCare was a mistake, and deal a really great plan!
Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOU'RE FIRED, I do not like firing people.
But ZERO on ObamaCare mess-no way!
Can you believe that "President" Karzai of Afghanistan is holding out for more, more, more and refuses to sign deal.
Tell him to go to hell!
I truly believe that our country has the worst and dumbest negotiators of virtually any country in the world.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE, ENJOY YOUR DAY!
I am in Miami at Trump National Doral.
Just gave out contract to build a new ballroom and luxury suites.
Blue Monster complete-opens Dec 14.
Work begins on the Old Post Office in Washington D.C. in 3 months.
It will soon become one of the great hotels of the world.
My ties, shirts and cufflinks have never been more beautiful-THE BEST-available at Macy's!
Congratulations to Dubai on winning the rights to host Expo 2020!
A great place winning a major global event.
Trump International in Dubai  will be one of the great projects anywhere in the world.
Congratulations to @damacofficial for their genius!
First Minister Salmond should stop his fruitless drive for obsolete wind turbines in Scotland-he would become popular again!
Today is the day that ObamaCare website was supposed to be up and working.
WRONG-website is closed down, a total disaster!
Just left $259 million rebuilding of Doral in Miami.
Amazing - Trump National Doral will be a masterpiece (if I do say so myself)!
Wow, the ObamaCare website, which President Obama said would be working TODAY, is a total mess with many functions not even thought about!
That was a great football game.
The least number of hurricanes in the U.S. in decades.
A fine man, Dr. Paul F. Crouch, has just passed away.
All Christians are grateful for his wonderful life and work.
Trump Int.
Dying @GQMagazine just named me to a list.
Too bad GQ is no longer relevant—won’t be around long!
Congratulations to the White House.
For every 1 ObamaCare enrollment there are 44 cancellation notices.
Very unfair!
Remember I predicted that New York Magazine would  fold and people scoffed?
Just announced (N.Y.Post) it lost big $'s & is cutting way back!
Too bad about New York Magazine, but there's a much bigger one out there, currently doing a story on me to get even, that I'll soon discuss!
I just filed a major ethics complaint against crooked New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman-he should resign from office!
With few exceptions, only really smart people are able to make a lot of money.
Hard work is also important, but "brains" will supersede.
You can only smile when the losers of the world try so hard to put down successful people.
Just remember, they all want to be YOU!
Wow, it’s now official.
New reality.
There are no short cuts to any place worth going.
Denver, Minnesota and others are bracing for some of the coldest weather on record.
What are the global warming geniuses saying about this?
Sleazebag @BashirLive has just been forced to resign from @msnbc.
His pathetic apology wasn’t enough to save his job.
Congrats to @msnbc for firing Martin Bashir—don’t feel badly, he didn’t get ratings anyway.
Wow, record setting cold temperatures throughout large parts of the country.
Must be global warming, I mean climate change!
The problem w/ the concept of "global warming" is that the U.S. is spending a fortune on "fixing it" while China & others do nothing!
@VattenfallGroup couldn’t sell its money losing Aberdeen windfarm—so @AlexSalmond forced phony extension..
Off shore windfarms being abandoned in droves throughout world—too expensive to build & operate—don’t work.
Why is it that when Warren Buffett uses the bankruptcy laws to his benefit, nobody cares, but with me they go nuts!
Leaving today for California to inspect my fantastic golf course & club on the Palos Verdes peninsula.
Big success.
Nelson Mandela and myself had a wonderful relationship--he was a special man and will be missed.
A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.
It always seems impossible until it is done.
Ice storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee - I'm in Los Angeles and it's freezing.
Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!
We should be focused on magnificently clean and healthy air and not distracted by the expensive hoax that is global warming!
@BillBratton was a great choice for NYC Police Commissioner.
He will make us proud, and safe!
Iran has never had a better friend than Obama.
Looking forward to hosting @NaghmehAbedini next week @TrumpTowerNY.
The White House has  abandoned her husband, Christian Pastor Abedini.
The now $1.2B ObamaCare website is as bad as ever-- insurers not getting the proper data.
It's Friday.
How much money has been wasted on defunct ObamaCare website today?
My shirts, ties & cufflinks @Macys have never been better or more beautiful.
Great holiday gifts, great price.
Don't underestimate yourself--or your possibilities.
There are always opportunities.
In making big money, knowledge is far more important than any other ingredient, including money itself!
Show me someone without an ego, and I'll show you a loser - having a healthy ego, or high opinion of yourself, is a real positive in life!
People are always asking me about the very special word, CONFIDENCE.
The fact is there is (almost) nothing like it.
Is derived from winning!
P.S. - There is also something really good to say about humility.
Being confident and humble is a great combination, maybe the best of all!
Just got back to New York from California.
Will be on Fox  & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00.
Obama said he never met his uncle, Oscar, who was arrested for whatever.
Turns out he lived with his uncle in Boston.
SO MANY LIES!
The Unaffordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as ObamaCare, is not working.
Millions of people are losing their plans and doctors-fraud!
I really enjoy doing @foxandfriends every Monday at 7 AM.
@sdoocy, @ehasselbeck and @kilmeade are great people.
Just left Florida, amazing how well State is doing-- jobs way up, taxes down.
Just read @PiersMorgan’s book “Shooting Straight” and whether you love him or hate him (I’m in the first category), it is terrific.
Congrats to @JoeTorre, @TonyLaRussa & Bobby Cox on all being unanimously elected to @MLB’s @BaseballHall!
Great leaders & managers.
It’s time for @PeteRose_14 to enter @MLB’s @BaseballHall.
All time hits leader has paid the price.
Graydon Carter, whose reign over failing @VanityFair has been a disaster, has acted in two movies--both bombed & got bad reviews.
Where’s the leadership?
WH claims it lied about Pres.
Obama living with his uncle b/c “wasn’t mentioned in his book”.
I guess Bill Ayers never knew about it!
Bird killing windfarm that I oppose in Aberdeen just got delayed by at least two years.
@AlexSalmond forced the failing developers to delay!
The ill-conceived windfarm that @AlexSalmond is pushing for Aberdeen will lose $50 million a year.
Only a fool would build it or want it!
Major League Baseball: The best thing you can do is let @PeteRose_14---your all time hits leader---into the Hall of Fame.
It's time!
State Senator Shirley Huntley "ratted" on black politicians & was believed--when she ratted on @AGSchneiderman, nobody listened.
Racism!
Naghmeh Abedini, the lovely wife of the Christian Pastor Saeed being held in an Iranian jail, just left my office.
Illegal use of official Attorney General stationary by lightweight @AGSchneiderman.
How can NYS allow lightweight @AGSchneiderman to remain in office?
What are JCOPE & Moreland Commissions waiting on?
Great meeting with @NaghmehAbedini the wonderful wife of Christian Pastor Saeed, who is in Iranian prison.
Come on MLB, do the right thing!
Let @PeteRose_14 into the Hall.
No drugs—just hard work and talent!
@MarkHalperin’s and John Heilemann’s  book, Double Down, is an excellent read on the just passed election.
Great book, congrats!
After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb..
@JohnKerry claims he has "never stopped working” f/Pastor Abedini’s release through “back channels".
Where are the results?
Re Kerry admitting to “working” for Pastor Abedini’s release--why has US already released Iranian spies & nuclear scientist?
Dumb!
It's amazing how badly the Knicks and Nets are playing.
Everybody predicted they would be top teams with all of the money spent.
Too bad!
President Obama's approval rating, at 38%, is at an all-time low.
Gee, I wonder why?
Why does Conde Nast allow dopey Graydon Carter to run bad food restaurants while running failing @VanityFair magazine?
I will be on Piers Morgan Live tonight at 9 P.M. on CNN.
Tune in!
This is one of the COLDEST WINTERS ever, freezing all over the country for long periods of time!
So much for GLOBAL WARMING.
Had dinner last night at Megu, 845 United Nations Plaza--fabulous food, beautiful restaurant.
Our prayers are with Rev.
@BillyGraham for a speedy recovery.
His faith continues to inspire us all.
A $1.5B website that can only handle 50K users at a time is sad but no surprise!
Exciting news—After massive construction, the Blue Monster at Trump National Doral is open for business today.
I hope you all are looking at the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection of ties, shirts & cufflinks @Macys—great for Christmas & holidays.
How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama’s “birth certificate” died in plane crash today.
What a sad thing that the  memory of Nelson Mandela will be stained by the phoney sign language moron who is in every picture at funeral!
Can you believe that the corrupt and pathetic South Africa police force has yet to arrest the sign language guy.
Such danger-give 10 years!
Economics behind ugly, bird killing wind turbines do not work--will destroy Scotland's beautiful coastline.
My complaint against @AGSchneiderman is a “case study” for JCOPE & Moreland Commissions on everything that is wrong with NYS politics.
Sources inside @AGSchneiderman’s office are saying that they are very concerned with the allegations against their lightweight boss.
Bird killing windfarm that I oppose in Aberdeen got delayed by at least two years.
@AlexSalmond forced the failing developers to delay!
The ill-conceived windfarm that @AlexSalmond is pushing for Aberdeen will lose $50 million a year.
Only a fool would build it or want it!
The evidence continues to mount against lightweight @AGSchneiderman.
It is time for JCOPE and Moreland Commissions to act.
I really like Nelson Mandela but South Africa is a crime ridden mess that is just waiting to explode-not a good situation for the people!
Have a GREAT weekend everybody - enjoy yourself but always keep your goals and aspirations in mind.
Never lose sight of the victory ahead!
The United States is experiencing the coldest weather in decades with vast amounts of snow blanketing many states.
President Obama and other world leaders don't know how close they were to being seriously injured (or worse) standing next to psycho in  SA.
Wow, it's snowing in Isreal and on the pyramids in Egypt.
Are we still wasting billions on the global warming con?
MAKE U.S. COMPETITIVE!
The "global warming" name isn't working anymore-SORRY!
They call it "climate change" now because the words "global warming" didn't work anymore.
Same people fighting hard to keep it all going!
We should be focusing on beautiful, clean air & not on wasteful & very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit!
Wow, just in-John Beale, the top person in government on climate change (EPA), is a total fraud, and just admitted it!
Wow, a really great review of my golf club in Scotland, @TrumpScotland, in todaysgolferco.
uk.
Thank you!
Who thinks that President Obama is totally incompetent?
Under President Obama, do you think America will become a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY?
Prime Minister @David_Cameron is very foolish in giving @AlexSalmond so much money to build wind turbines which r destroying Scotland.
Congrats to Pres.
Unsustainable.
Garbage released after garbage.
What is going on in these studios?!
FRACK NOW & FRACK FAST!!!
American prosperity depends on it.
Our economic renaissance is here.
I have never met a successful person that was a quitter.
Successful people never, ever, give up!
The Trump Signature Collection is the best menswear design for young entrepreneurs.
Great style & design exclusively available @Macys.
Alternatives are important but first Repubs must repeal ObamaCare.
It's an unsustainable monstrosity that's destroying our healthcare.
For all of those that think life is easy & don’t want to work, remember: HOPE IS THE POOR MAN’S BREAD.
I just left the Trump Tower atrium--it is packed with great people.
The more time you spend feeling sorry for yourself, the more time you waste after a setback.
Move on and quickly embrace the next challenge!
The coolest story is that John Beale, the man who headed up CLIMATE CHANGE for the government, is a proven con man and total phoney.
Go to Macy's today and buy Trump ties, shirts, suits and cufflinks as a Christmas or holiday present.
Great style, great price!
I like Rob Astorino.
He's a friend and really good guy.
Sadly, he has ZERO chance of beating Cuomo and the 2 to 1 Dems for governor!
Enough about my ties etc.
@Macys, but they are doing really big numbers - people love them (and @Macys loves Trump)!
New York Republican leader @EdwardFCox is pushing my friend @RobAstorino into political suicide.
Results won’t be pleasant!
I am so honored by all the great NY State Repubs who came to my office, called & wrote for me to run for Governor.
If I do, I will win.
No cuts to welfare, no cuts to food stamps & NOT A SINGLE CUT TO OBAMACARE, yet the new budget cuts military benefits.
Sad!
Pres.
Obama is about to embark on a 17 day vacation in his ‘native’ Hawaii, putting Secret Service away from families on Christmas.
Aloha!
Every day Pastor Saeed is imprisoned by Iran is an indictment on Obama’s ‘diplomacy.
A really nice article about the Blue Monster from “The Street”.
Young Entrepreneurs – the Holiday season is here but that is no excuse not to stay on top of your business prospects.
Focus!
Can’t fool Americans.
If you fail once, twice, three times, it doesn't matter.
Learn from your mistakes and push forward to VICTORY-the sweetest feeling there is!
White House relaxes penalty for canceled health policies, a major blow  to the sustainability (and concept) of ObamaCare!
Trump National Hudson Valley's 7,693 yd, par 72 course features one of the country's great golf courses.
It’s Friday.
How many people have been forced off their plans and lost their doctors today because of ObamaCare?
What's with this rap stuff with me and Ebenezer Scrooge?
If you can’t adapt to new situations then you will never be successful.
Every change is a new opportunity to use your talent.
Guess what, folks--the ObamaCare website just went down again.
What a disaster.
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is pushing for the Moreland Commission to be disbanded immediately--because he is being looked at!
Secret Service members on break from Obama’s $4M vacation are more than welcomed to relax at Hawaii’s top hotel @TrumpWaikiki..
@Richard_Meier, a highly overrated architect, has had many problems with buildings he has designed..
@AGSchneiderman Why is Douglas Durst allowed to use the Freedom Tower to get out of a lease with Conde Nast?
Personally, I think Douglas Durst's brother got screwed by Douglas--no wonder he's angry.
If you don't believe in yourself, no one else will.
Fernando, thank you for the GREAT review of The Blue Monster in South Florida Golf-especially top 10 in the WORLD.
I love @SOFLAGOLF!
Remember, THE HARDER YOU WORK, THE LUCKIER YOU GET!
It was 25 years ago today that Pan Am flight 103 was downed by a terrorist killing 270 innocent people.
@AlexSalmond released the terrorist!
I am going to Trump National Doral in Miami today to check out the brand new and just opened BLUE MONSTER and the spectacular driving range.
The Herschel Walker interview on The Tim McCarver Show was  fantastic-much can be learned from watching.
Congrats to Herschel and Tim!
Will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00 - hope you enjoy!
Entrepreneurs: Be ready for problems--you'll have them every day.
Keep open to new ideas--that's where innovation begins.
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort.
You're in charge--everything starts with you.
Did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster.
Never look back, just learn from your experience!
SOMETIMES YOUR BEST INVESTMENTS ARE THE ONES YOU DON'T MAKE!
ALWAYS TRY TO LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLES MISTAKES, NOT YOUR OWN - IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAT WAY!
Entrepreneurs: Apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious.
See yourself as victorious--which means never giving up.
Entrepreneurs: Whatever happens, you're responsible.
If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.
Entrepreneurs: Put everything you've got into what you're doing.
Be totally focused--nothing should be haphazard.
I'd like to wish all of my friends--and even my many enemies--a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
I could fix existing Tappan Zee Bridge for peanuts.
Unfortunately, Gov Cuomo will end up spending more than $10B on this project.
$25 tolls?
Without passion you don't have energy, and without energy, you don't have anything!
Merry Christmas, have an amazing day!
The new Pope is a humble man, very much like me, which probably explains why I like him so much!
I hope everybody is having a FANTASTIC Christmas!
No matter how tough things may seem remember that you will ride it out & go on to victory!
O.K., Christmas is over, now we can all go back to the wars of life.
Focus, focus, focus-never accept defeat -push hard for total victory!
Celebrating New Year's Eve in the Windy City?
Thank you to @AmSpec & Jeffrey Lord for the lovely article “Governor Trump?
The conservative Nelson Rockefeller”.
Will be working with contractors at Trump National Doral in Miami today.
The rescue icebreaker, trying to free the ship of the GLOBAL WARMING scientists, has turned back-the ice is  massive (a record).
IRONIC!
We should be focused on clean and beautiful air-not expensive and business closing GLOBAL WARMING-a total hoax!
The global warming  scientists don't want to be airlifted off the ship-they are having too much fun and that is too simple a solution-FAME!
In the upcoming New Year we will focus like never before - if we do that we will have complete and total VICTORY in all we do!
Temperature at record lows in many parts of the country.
Global warming folks iced in!
Be tough, be focused.
There are a lot of ups and downs, but you can ride them out if you're prepared for them.
Ask yourself, "Is this a blip or is it a catastrophe"?
and your equilibrium will be kept in check if/when hard times hit.
Cover your bases--know everything you can about what you're doing.
Keep your focus by being well informed on a daily basis.
Congratulations to @woodyjohnson4 and @nyjets on yesterday's very exciting game.
Entrepreneurs – be tough, resolute & trustworthy.
The most crucial time to build your reputation is when you start making deals.
What the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING.
The con artists changed the name from GLOBAL WARMING to CLIMATE CHANGE when GLOBAL WARMING was no longer working and credibility was lost!
Spend your last day of 2013 contemplating the moves you will make in 2014 to make it your best year ever!
Make sure to have fun and celebrate NYE with friends and family.
Happy New Year everyone!
When it comes to money, finance and even life, PROTECT THE DOWNSIDE AND THE UPSIDE WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF!
Have a happy, successful and healthy New Year!
Today is the first day of the rest of your life - make the most of it!
This very expensive GLOBAL WARMING bullshit has got to stop.
Entrepreneurs are visionaries in some respects--they look beyond the present.
Keep that in mind when looking for opportunities.
It's Jan.
President Obama should end his vacation early & get back to Washington to straighten out the ObamaCare catastrophe--or end it.
Snowden should come back to America and face justice.
Instead, he is begging for clemency from Moscow.
Treat him as a spy.
I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.
A regular part of your day should be devoted to expanding your horizons.
Learning is a new beginning.
Try to develop a tempo when you're working--momentum is something you have to work at to maintain, & is an important element of success.
Record snowfall & freezing temps throughout the country.
Where is Global Warming when you need it?!
Another one of my predictions just came true-- Iraq is a total disaster with government losing all control—so sad.
Sec of State Kerry said we would not go back to Iraq.
We shouldn’t, but he should not have said that.
So stupid!
Entrepreneurs: Set the example and you'll be a magnet for the right people.
Great leaders determine the teams they assemble.
Have your own vision & stick with it.
Don't be afraid to be unique.
Every day is an opportunity to show what you can do at the highest level.
We are experiencing the coldest weather in more than two decades-most people never remember anything like this.
GLOBAL WARMING anyone?
Looking forward to hosting the @FloridaGOP “House Majority 2014 Golf Tournament” at Trump Int'l West Palm Beach on Jan.
Congratulations to @BretBaier on his five year anniversary as the anchor @SpecialReport.
Brett is great!
Achievers move forward at all times.
Don't tread water.
Get out there and go for it.
Remember to think big by expanding your horizons at the same time you're expanding your net worth.
Identify your goals.
Know precisely what you want to achieve, study the best people in your field,and then plan the best route for success.
Please, @21Club, go back to your original menu and preparation.
Believe me, it was much better.
Let me know when the change is made!
While I am a critic of President Obama, I hate it when someone (Robert Gates) writes a self serving negative book about his boss.
Why didn’t Gates resign if he was so unhappy about what he was being told by Obama?
The fact is, Iraq etc.
have always been disasters!
Tomorrow is the 10 year anniversary of the Apprentice, one of the biggest hits in television history.
How time flies!
We had a GREAT year @Macys with ties, shirts and suits, thanks!
New selections just arrived - they are amazing!
The news about our beautiful Miss Venezuela, Monica Spear, is devastating to all who knew her.
A spectacular woman, she will be missed.
Thanks everybody for the Happy Birthday greetings, but it’s actually the 10th birthday of The Apprentice.
My birthday is June 14th....
The Trump Organization continues to expand internationally at a record pace.
Many new announcements to come soon.
It’s Thursday.
How many people have lost their healthcare today?
Be tough, be smart, be personable, but don't take things personally.
That's good business.
Focus on your goals, not your problems.
Problems are a mind exercise--learn to play beyond your comfort zone.
The brand new Blue Monster just opened at Trump National Doral - Miami.
Also, great new driving range which is open 'till midnight.
GO SEE!
President Obama just fired the ObamaCare website builder.
My question is, why were they hired in the first place?
Sue them for damages!
Now that the ObamaCare website contractor has been terminated for obvious incompetence, is the person who hired them going to be fired?
In politics, and sometimes in life, FRIENDS COME AND GO, BUT ENEMIES ACCUMULATE!
Whether you like Obama or not, Bob Gates turned out to be one disloyal dude!
Personally, I hate rats.
I will be doing Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00.
Will be discussing all sorts of current disasters!
The Republican Party of New York has been conditioned to lose, and there is no excuse for this.
Leadership must move fast and decisively!
After watching all about the horror story that is A-Rod, I realized again that it is time to let Pete Rose into the Baseball Hall of Fame!
Will be doing Fox & Friends in a few minutes - hope you enjoy!
Anticipate change and embrace it.
Recognize new developments that you can capitalize on and use to open new doors.
Understand that difficulties, mistakes & setbacks are an inevitable part of business and life.
Don't allow them to knock you off your feet.
Focus on your goals, not on fixed patterns.
Do what's necessary and what's unnecessary will be made clear.
Yankees should have dropped A-Rod long ago, not even bothered with arbitration.
They would have saved a fortune!
Resilience is part of the survival of the fittest formula--make sure you remain adaptable.
For great success, you need passion, but make sure it's well directed.
Learn everything you can about what you're doing.
Be an expert.
Think positively.
Zap negativity immediately.
Focus on the solution, not the problem.
Be persistent and alert--every single day.
Momentum!
Watching Gates on @seanhannity - looks like he got hit by a truck!
Why didn't Obama get him, and others,to sign a confidentiality agreement?
A-Rod’s lawsuit trying to overturn a binding arbitration agreement is going nowhere.
He should be banned from spring training.
Gabriel Sherman’s book on Roger Ailes is filled with falsehoods and inaccuracies.
Publisher should be ashamed (and sued).
The Senate should immediately vote on the Iranian sanctions bill.
What is the delay?
Where is the progress in the state of New York over the last three years?
There is none--only backwards.
I would like to thank a great writer and person, @JPappasPR.
, of REAL ESTATE WEEKLY, for the wonderful story on me.
Very much appreciated!
I hope we never find life on another planet because if we do there's no doubt that the United States will start sending them money!
Department of Homeland Security has spent $3.5 billion dollars building their new headquarters and is years late and billions over budget!
To be a winner, think like a winner.
Practice positive thinking--with reality checks.
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is fighting with @NYGovCuomo –Cuomo wins that one easily.
Schneiderman is a total loser.
Great article by @AmSpec's Jeffrey Lord: “The Reagan Revolution.
And now… the @realDonaldTrump Revolution?
Looking forward to being hosted by @saintanselm for Politics & Eggs next Tuesday.
See you in Manchester!
Trust your instincts.
They are there for a reason.
Without instincts, you'll have a hard time getting to--and staying at--the top.
To get momentum, you must first focus on a specific goal with passion and intensity.
Wow, just heard that that next Tuesday’s @saintanselm Politics & Eggs is the largest crowd ever.
Looking forward to making new friends.
To be really successful it is always good to have A COOL HEAD, WARM HEART AND BEAUTIFUL COMMON TOUCH!
Fox & Friends at 7.
Movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who lost his company to Colony Capital, is against guns but makes movies w/ major gun violence--really!
WWII vs.
Now!
People often ask me the secret to my success, and the answer is simple: passion, focus and hard work.
Momentum keeps it all going.
Excited for tomorrow’s Politics & Eggs @saintanselm co-hosted by @NECouncil & @nhiop.
Hope & Change!
Learning to expect problems saved me from a lot of wasted energy.
Winners see problems as just another way to prove themselves.
Happy Anniversary to my wonderful wife @MELANIATRUMP -- a truly great decision by me!
Set high standards and meet them.
The proof is in the doing: learn by doing and taking risks.
Will be leaving Palm Beach for the 11 A.M. ceremony opening the magnificent GARY PLAYER VILLA at Trump Nationak Doral, Miami.
GARY IS GREAT!
For all of those who have been asking, a big cast announcement coming soon for @ApprenticeNBC!
via WSJ.
Wake up @AlexSalmond before you destroy Scotland.
When times are difficult, you must be even more focused.
That’s when you will find profitable opportunities.
Have the right mindset for the job.
See your work as an art form--which means paying attention to every detail.
NBC News just called it the great freeze - coldest weather in years.
Is our country still spending money on the GLOBAL WARMING HOAX?
Any and all weather events are used by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our planet!
They don't believe it $$$$!
Do you really believe our once great country can continue to survive with incompetent leadership.
The answer is no and we better move fast!
Will be on Fox & Friends at 7.00 -  Enjoy!
Give your goals substance.
Imbue them with a value that exceeds the monetary.
Make them count on as many levels as you can.
Passion gives great momentum and can be the catalyst for great achievement.
For entrepreneurs, ignorance is not bliss.
It's fatal.
It's costly.
And it's for losers.
You either get organized, or get crushed.
Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits.
Apple's iPhone sales fell way short-they must go to a larger screen, as alternative, fast (as I said long ago)!
Samsung's size much better.
I predicted Apple's stock fall based on their dumb refusal to give the option of a larger  iPhone screen like Samsung.
Steve Jobs is spinning in his grave - Apple has lost both vision and momentum - must move fast to get magic back!
How much is New York State spending on that obnoxious T.V. commercial that is being played endlessly for a tax incentive that doesn't work?
Creativity and control can go hand in hand.
Brainpower is the ultimate leverage.
Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond.
Global warming is an expensive hoax!
The weather has been so cold for so long that the global warming HOAXSTERS were forced to change the name to climate change to keep $ flow!
Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit!
I am tired of hearing this nonsense.
I will be on the Mike & Mike Show on radio and ESPN-at about 6 to 7 A.M.
We will be talking Super Bowl and sports-no Obama Care!
Mike & Mike in one minute!
It was great being on @MikeAndMike in the Morning (ESPN)—two great guys, fantastic show!
Welcome to the new reality!
Moody’s just downgraded the entire US health insurance industry because of ObamaCare.
Always leave your ego at the door during negotiations.
Remember, it’s only business and there will always be another day!
Just received a wonderful letter from a new father who bought his son his first book, The Art of the Deal.
Great parent!
Wow, honored to just pass 2.5M followers on @twitter.
Thanks to all my followers.
We are going to have a great year together.
Once ObamaCare is fully enacted in NY, conveniently after 2014, expect higher premiums, bigger deductibles, & worse care.
Job killer!
Press conference at the opening of the @GaryPlayer Villa at @TrumpDoral .
Failing comedian Bill Maher, who I got an accidental glimpse of the other night, is really a dumb guy, just look at his past!
Remember when "comedian" Bill Maher openly praised the disgusting terrorists who destroyed the World Trade Center-then got canned by ABC?
With one of the worst and most prolonged cold spells in history, with Atlanta, Texas and parts of Florida freezing- Global Warming anyone?
Obama said in his SOTU that “global warming is a fact”.
Sure, about as factual as “if you like your healthcare, you can keep it”.
The NY SAFE Act is an unconstitutional attack on 2nd Amendment rights.
Will also increase crime.
Are Republicans suicidal?
Now they want to push amnesty through Congress.
Allowing Democrats into the country..
@IamStevenT stopped by my office to say hello- a great guy!
Raffaele Sollecito was unfairly convicted.
He didn’t kill anyone.
The Italian government should be ashamed.
Looking forward to being hosted by @NickLangworthy’s Erie County Lincoln Leadership Reception tonight.
Record crowd!
Can't wait.
Wow--tremendous victory in the Trump University case against lightweight @AGSchneiderman--just got the news!
For information on Trump University victory, call Alan Garten, Esquire, at 212.836.3203 or Jeff Goldman, Esquire, at 212.867.4466.
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman just got his ass kicked by Trump!
To Jamie Dimon—I love kicking lightweight @AGSchneiderman’s ass.
Stop settling and fight!
Enjoy the Super Bowl!
This may be the worst football game ever played by one team, Denver!
Hard to watch.
I can't get over, after all of the buildup, what a terrible game that was-the worst Super Bowl in history.
The advertisers must be furious!
The @Broncos had a truly bad day--my advice is to go home, forget about it, and come back tough next year.
Watch commodity prices soar because of the freezing cold.
Will be bad for the economy.
We could use some global warming.
The President of the U.S. is the leader of the Free World.
He should dress like it at all times.
Wear a suit and a tie for major interviews.
Rio de Janeiro joins the @TrumpCollection in 2016.
It’s going to be a spectacular hotel!
Wind energy is a complete economic disaster….
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.
The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
Congrats to Pres.
Obama and Dems.
CBO estimates over 2.
Congress should be worried about American workers not people who came into our country by breaking our laws.
Massive record setting  snowstorm and freezing temperatures in U.S. Smart that GLOBAL WARMING hoaxsters changed name to CLIMATE CHANGE!
When will our country stop wasting money on global warming and so many other truly "STUPID" things and begin to focus on lower taxes?
Wow, just in - ObamaCare projected to cause large scale drop in jobs - even Dems are shocked by 2.5 million number.
DISASTER!
The Blue Monster Golf Course officially opens tomorrow at Trump National Doral with a ribbon cutting ceremony.
GREAT COURSE, GREAT REVIEWS!
Negotiation: It is persuasion more than power.
Never allow your attitude to be a liability.
Be positive and strong.
Set your mind on winning-- and keep it there.
How does frumpy & little read @nytimes editorial writer Gail Collins keep her job?
She is totally irrelevant!
Doing Fox & Friends at 7.00 A.M. ENJOY!
Anytime you see someone talking about celebrity weight loss on my "twitter" it is a total scam!
Governor Cuomo only cut the Verrazano Bridge tolls because I made it a major point in speeches.
I love the people of Staten Island!
Great purchase in Ireland--- will be a top spot!
Looking forward to addressing the record setting crowd tonight at the New York County Lincoln Day Dinner.
Lots to talk about!
The people of Ireland have been so great about my purchase of Doonbeg -- I'll be there soon.
My sons Don and Eric are right now at Doonbeg in Ireland.
There will be nothing like it!
Make it special!
If ObamaCare is such a wonderful law then why does Obama summarily  change the law before an election?
My sons, Don and Eric, are in Ireland looking at my new club.
It will be phenomenal!
If Scotland doesn’t stop insane policy of obsolete, bird killing wind turbines, country will be destroyed.
Great making keynote speech at 2014 Lincoln Day Dinner, hosted by Dan Isaacs & NY Republican County Committee.
Wonderful  people!
A big part of the country, even the southern states, is under massive attack from snow and freezing cold.
Global warming anyone?
Give your goals substance -- make them count on as many levels as you can.
Remember that passion can be the catalyst for great achievement.
Do you believe the way Karzai talks down to the United States - zero respect!
My new club on the Atlantic Ocean in Ireland will soon be one of the best in the World - and no-one will be looking into ugly wind turbines!
The Irish government is too smart to destroy their beautiful coastline w/ bird-killing, ugly wind turbines.
I hope that Derek Jeter has such a fantastic year with @Yankees that he changes his mind about retiring.
Great guy!
Set the bar high--do the best you possibly can.
Be focused, disciplined and alert every single day.
The brand new Blue Monster Golf Course at Trump National Doral is doing fantastic business.
Also, the new driving range is open at night!
How come discredited reporter @mckaycoppins refused to write that the events in New Hampshire, Buffalo and N.Y. were all record breakers!
I never equated wind farms to the Pan Am Lockerbie disaster - only stated that @AlexSalmond should never have released the terrorist - BAD!
Due to the holiday, I will NOT be doing Fox & Friends this morning.
Next Monday at 7.
Don't let the GLOBAL WARMING wiseguys get away with changing the name to CLIMATE CHANGE because the FACTS do not let GW tag to work anymore!
Do you believe this one - Secretary of State John Kerry just stated that the most dangerous weapon of all today is climate change.
Do you think John Kerry is aware of the fact that they are building nuclear weapons in Iran and North Korea and  Pakistan already has them!!
It's not climate change,it's global warming.
A legitimate article about me...
Thank you Jeffrey Lord for the great article discrediting third rate @BuzzFeed site & slimebag reporter McKay Coppins.
Bloggers like McKay Coppins & @BuzzFeed are true garbage with no credibility.
Record setting crowds & speech not reported.
Amazing story in @BreitbartNews about the sleazebag blogger Coppins who fabricated nonsense about me for irrelevant @BuzzFeed.
CONGRATS!
Ben Smith (is that really his last name?
) of @BuzzFeed is a total mess who probably got his minion Coppins to do what he didn't want to do?
I wonder how much money dumb @BuzzFeed and even dumber Ben Smith loooose each year?
They have zero credibility - totally irrelevant and sad!
Isn't it crazy, I'm worth billions of dollars, employ thousands of people, and get libeled by  moron bloggers who can't afford a suit!
WILD.
My friend @eminofficial was fantastic on the @TODAYshow this morning—a star!
I read @willweatherford’s comments that “the lights are dimming on gambling in Florida”—nothing could be worse for the state..
@FLGovScott  Gaming states are laughing at stupidity of not approving gaming in FL—they’re afraid of Miami—can’t believe their luck!
@willweatherford @FLGovScott  Gaming in Miami will be incredible—best in world and create lots of jobs and revenue.
Internal polling shows that I would swamp @RobAstorino  in a NY Republican primary 77% to 23%.
But won’t run if party is not unified.
NY State Republican Party must unify or November will be another disaster.
For the NY State Repubs to waste time, energy and money on a primary—then go against 3-1 Dems—is insane.
Governor Cuomo is right about one thing - Attorney General Eric Schneiderman does wear eyeliner!
What the hell is up with him?
A poll of the Miami-Dade was conclusively in favor of gambling in Miami.
Individual commitment to a group effort  is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work..
@FLGovScott can create tens of thousands of jobs by approving casinos in Miami--it's time.
I took a failed club in Dutchess County & made it a great success plus many jobs.
@KieranLalor should be thankful..
@KieranLalor  I created far more jobs and success in Dutchess than you--you should be "Fired"..
@MichaelRCaputo Thank you for all of your support, you have been amazing!
@AllenWest  Great seeing you last night at record setting Mar-a-Lago Republican event.
The crowd loved you!
@danawhite - You have done an amazing job - I am proud to have been there at the very beginning!
Do you think that very dumb reporter(blogger) McKay Coppins has apologized to his wife for his very inappropriate behavior while in Florida?
Russia beat the United States in the Olympics-another Obama embarrassment!
Isn't it time that we turn things around and start kicking ass?
Will be doing Fox & Friends at 7 A.M. - 20 minutes.
ENJOY!
Whether you like it or not, the Russians did a great job in hosting the Olympics!
Remember when Obama went to Europe to get Olympics-fourth.
We could make America great again by spreading ObamaCare throughout the World while at the same time  dropping it from U.S.!
Entrepreneurs:  Everything starts with you.
Leadership is not a group effort--if you're in charge, then be in charge.
Entrepreneurs:  Don't expect anyone to be on your side.
Sometimes we're all in this alone.
So believing in yourself is mandatory.
Entrepreneurs: Keep your momentum.
See yourself as victorious and leading a winning team.
Keep everyone moving forward.
Building a personal brand?
Then focus on being great.
Focus on being the best at what you do.
Iraq buying $200,000,000 worth of weapons from Iran.
Despite so many killed and trillions spent, Iraq dumps U.S. I TOLD YOU SO LONG AGO!
Congrats @marklevinshow on fantastic article--when “B” writes so nicely about you, it really means something.
Models!
Remember to register for the Trump Model Search.
To aspiring entrepreneurs:  Be focused!
Know your goals.
Put everything you've got into what you're doing--every single day.
To aspiring entrepreneurs:  Trust your instincts.
They are there for a reason.
To aspiring entrepreneurs:  Be ready for problems.
You'll have them every day.
So remember to look at the solution--not the problem.
To aspiring entrepreneurs: Be tenacious.
Once you've decided on your goals, remain fixed on them.
Set the bar high!
Just did final purchase on fabulous @LodgeatDoonbeg in Ireland.
Will become Trump International Hotel & Golf Links, Ireland.
Very exciting!
Wow, NY Observer story about @AGSchneiderman really exposes him as a sleazebag & crook.
He’s bad for New York.
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is driving business out of NY so that he can get publicity for his failing political career.
Success tip: Achievers move forward at all times.
Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
Success tip: Don't tread water.
Get out there and go for it.
There's nothing wrong with bringing your talents to the surface.
Success tip:  Keep the big picture in mind.
There are always opportunities & possibilities, & thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
Disappointed the @NewYorkObserver article on @AGSchneiderman did not bring up his dealings w/ Shirley Huntley..
@AGSchneiderman has never once said that he didn’t ask for campaign contributions during the investigation.
Congrats to Charles @krauthammer for his statements on climate change, formerly known as global warming!
Congrats to R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr of @AmSpec for the fantastic piece on Benghazi.
I think the @NewYorkObserver was far too nice to sleazebag @AGSchneiderman.
He’s got plenty more to worry about!
Black politicians are in prison based on Shirley Huntley’s statements but not white @AGSchneiderman RACISM!
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman’s phony lawsuit against Trump U was decimated by the court—he’s a loser!
Congrats to R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr of @AmSpec for the fantastic piece on Benghazi.
Obama just stated "he didn't take school seriously, made bad choices and GOT HIGH" - then how the hell did he get into Columbia & Harvard?
The U.S. has appealed ro Russia not to intervene in Ukraine - Russia tells U.S. they will not become involved, and then laughs loudly!
The World is falling apart around us, but we don't have people who know how to play the game.
The U.S. is in big trouble - no leadership!
I'll be playing golf tomorrow in Palm Beach at the number one rated golf course in the State of Florida, Trump International Golf Club..
@MarkBurnettTV and his incredible wife @RealRomaDowney did a fabulous movie, @SonofGodMovie- see it!
China has just intervened to lower the yuan- in other words, they will continue to screw the U.S.!
Will be playing golf today with Rand Paul at Trump International in Palm Beach.
Will be both interesting and fun!
I am at Trump National Doral in Miami as the best golfers in the World start arriving for the World Golf Championship (Cadillac).
I'm having a real hard time watching the Academy Awards (so far).
The last song was terrible!
Kim should sue her plastic surgeon!
Is this boring or is it just me?
Just terrible!
Certain people are ruining their reputations tonight-really sad!
Do you believe this singing?
Ellen is sadly having a hard time with her lines.
I don't know how much longer I can take this bullshit - so terrible!
Judy Garland was much better, to put it mildly!
Little Andy Lassner, who lives his life through Ellen and has nothing else going for himself, is having a really bad night!
They should have allowed applause during the TRIBUTE to the departed - Really bad production.
Bette Midler sucked!
This is Amateur Night - who the hell is in charge of this production?
Was President Obama in charge of this years Academy Awards - they remind me of the ObamaCare website!
Angelina and Sidney had a really strange vibe going!
M.M. is a good choice - also, nice guy!
What is he reading?
Ellen was so awkward and insecure last night.
The pizza skit was terrible.
She should dump Andy Lassner, a guy with no absolutely no talent!
I have always liked Ellen, done her show numerous times, but she was not good last night - fumbling and stumbling!
Very exciting week for @TrumpDoral.
I will be in Miami opening what will soon be best resort in U.S. World Golf Championship this week!
@JTimberlake It was great having you play The Blue Monster.
Thanks for your nice statements-many agree that it is best they've seen!
@Mitt Romney strongly stated, in one of the debates with Pres.
OBAMA, that Russia is the big problem.
Obama scoffed.
Mitt was 100% correct!
Baltimore just set a record for the coldest day in March in a long recorded history - 4 degrees.
Other places likewise.
Global warming con!
What do you think Obama will do when Putin seizes Alaska?
Actually Putin doesn't want Alaska because the Environmental Protection Agency will make it impossible for him to drill for oil!
Remember to keep going--if you stop, your momentum will stop.
If you're passionate about your work, you will never give up.
Live on the edge--no complacency is allowed--and keep an open mind.
Business is a creative endeavor.
Success breeds success.
The best way to impress people is through results.
-- Think Like a Billionaire.
Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto continues to receive accolades.
Great city, great hotel.
Of course I don't think Jimmy Carter is dead-saw him today on T.V. Just being sarcastic, but never thought he was alive as President, stiff!
Actually I was very nice to Jimmy Carter during my standing room only (& standing ovation) speech for CPAC - stated better Pres.
than Obama!
The unbiased reporters and attendees said mine was the best and most well received speech at CPAC - THANK YOU!
Congrats to @AlCardenasACU and @CPACnews.
I really enjoyed being there—the response was so terrific!
The newly built Blue Monster at Trump National Doral is being considered a "masterpiece" by almost all who see it and play it - THANK YOU!
Leaders at Trump National Doral are only one under par.
The great Ben Hogan said, "I've never seen a great course that was easy"!
Will be on Fox & Friends at 7 (10 minutes).
ENJOY!
Congratulations to Patrick Reed for winning at Trump National Doral.
Other  worthy people were taken off the @CNBC list as well.
Stupid poll should be canceled—no credibility.
I’ve been watching very little @CNBC lately—the good news is I’m switching over to  @BloombergNews and @FoxNews.
The massive Blue Monster @TrumpDoral is getting rave reviews.
I built it in one year—no easy feat!
Have passion, drive, and enthusiasm?
JUST IN:  A jury awarded a complete and total victory in buyer’s remorse lawsuit against me in Ft.
Lauderdale.
With the complete Ft.
Lauderdale victory, I will now sue for millions of $’s in attorney fees for which plaintiffs are liable.
I love taking lawsuits all the way when I’m right.
@AGSchneiderman  is finding that out the hard way!
Congratulations to @TrumpIntRealty for the two top rentals in 2013!
Just did theToday Show to announce that Baton Rouge, Louisiana will host the Miss USA Pageant on Sunday, June 8th.
@Miss USA.
I just beat a lawyer from Yale and a lawyer from Harvard, who teamed up against me, in a major case worth millions ($).
They were so dumb!
I have clearly stated that if the New York State Republican Party is able to unify, I would run for Governor and win.
They can't unify -SAD!
The top leadership of the New York State Republican Party is totally dysfunctional - they haven't won a major election in many years.
While I won't be running for Governor of New York State, a race I would have won, I have much bigger plans in mind- stay tuned, will happen!
@garyplayer  As a true champion you must have enjoyed how difficult but fair The Blue Monster played last weekend.
Gary Player Villa loved!
Frumpy and very dumb Gail Collins, an editorial writer at The New York Times, is so lucky to even have a job.
Check her out - incompetent!
When nobody wanted the UFC, I opened the way by letting them fight at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.
Dana White has done a great job!
I won't be doing Fox & Friends tomorrow morning in that I have a big breakfast meeting on a deal.
I will be back next week at 7.
Thank you!
Join @autismspeaks and light the world blue on 4/2.
There are many editorial writers that are good, some great, & some bad.
But the least talented of all is frumpy Gail Collins of NYTimes.
I'm helping him go to Disney, won't you?
Some people dream of great accomplishments while others stay awake and do them!
Wow, Putin is really taking advantage of President Obama.
It is important that Obama responds with strength and determination-be smart-cool!
President Obama could totally solve the problem with Putin by demanding that Russia sign on to ObamaCare, thereby destroying their economy!
Business is an art in itself & powerful negotiation skills are one of the techniques necessary to facilitate success.
The Donald J. Trump Signature Collection's new line is out @Macys --ties, shirts, accessories -- great & going fast!
Re Negotiation: Know what you want & think about what the other side wants.
Know where they’re coming from & do not underestimate them..
@AlexSalmond, Wind turbines are ripping your country apart and killing tourism.
It's almost like the United States has no President - we are a rudderless ship heading for a major disaster.
Good luck everyone!
Plane was carrying those terrible lithium ion batteries, which are highly combustible, as cargo.
Fire could have started in cockpit.
Lithium ion batteries should  not be allowed to be used in aircraft.
I won't fly on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner - it uses those batteries.
Looks like plane may have been found in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia.
President Obama was able to fool the Americans by getting elected, but not able to fool Vladimir Putin.
Too bad for us!
We're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers, and that's OK-but how much are Russia & China spending?
I don't hate Obama at all, I just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history!
While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World, President Obama is watching March Madness (basketball)!
President Obama, be cool, be smart, be sharp and FOCUS (no more March Madness), and you can beat Putin at his own game.
IT CAN BE DONE!
Great advice from my father: "Know everything you can about what you're doing".
Great advice from my mother: “Trust in God and be true to yourself”.
Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity.
Obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers.
I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire.
He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.!
We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever.
The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III.
Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off "March.
Madness", and LEAD!
Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare!
I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone.
I hear they will be doing it soon—long overdue.
Obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off Air Force One.
Doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall.
Thank you to @GaryVanSickle & Sports Illustrated @SInow  for the really nice piece about me.
Getting to the point is appreciated by everyone.
Here's some advice for public speaking: "Be sincere; be brief; be seated".
Robert Slater, who just passed away, was a terrific writer who wrote a very fair book about me.
He will be missed.
President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands.
Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC.
This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components - not rolling over and dealing from weakness!
Some great quotes from the legendary and courageous Winston Churchill: "Never, never, never give up"....
Remember, oftentimes the best deal you make is the deal you don't make!
@genesimmons is terrific--congratulations on Hall of Fame.
Autism WAY UP - I believe in vaccinations but not massive, all at once, shots.
Too much for small child to handle.
Govt.
should stop NOW!
If I were President I would push for proper vaccinations but would not allow one time massive shots that a small child cannot take - AUTISM.
Coach W to his basketball players - BE QUICK BUT DON'T HURRY!
Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM.
Many such cases!
With autism being way up, what do we have to lose by having doctors give small dose vaccines vs.
big pump doses into those tiny bodies?
Join @autismspeaks, and light the world blue on 4/2.
For Entrepreneurs: A good question to ask yourself –“What can I provide that does not yet exist?
Entrepreneurs:  Another question to ask yourself—“What am I pretending not to see?
” There may be great opportunities right around you.
Entrepreneurs:  Believe in yourself.
If you don’t, no one else will either.
Realize that becoming an entrepreneur is not a group effort.
To all young (and old) entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself, talk yourself up!
Energize yourself and you'll energize others.
To all haters and losers: I am NOT anti-vaccine, but I am against shooting massive doses into tiny children.
Spread shots out over time..
@ArsenioHall - The only thing you don't mention in the nice Esquire piece about you is The Apprentice, without which you would be nowhere!
@ArsenioHall - How quickly people forget, but not me!
You told me that without The Apprentice you could never have gotten your show - Sad!
@genesimmons  Keep up the great work and congrats - we are proud of you!
@MagicJohnson  Good luck with the Dodgers this season, if they were like you they would never lose a game!
Sorry, couldn't do @foxandfriends this morning--big meeting.
Will double up next week at 7.
Because of President Obama's failed leadership, we have put Vladimir Putin & Russia back on the world stage!
--No reason for this.
Noisy windfarm driving community crazy!
In New York, March was the coldest month in recorded history - we could use some GLOBAL WARMING!
Entrepreneurs: Be cautiously optimistic.
Call it positive thinking with a lot of reality checks.
Entrepreneurs: Pay attention to details.
If you don’t know everything about what you’re doing, you'll be in for some big surprises.
Entrepreneurs: Watching you could be the motivation for your employees.
Make it an example that will best serve the success of your business.
I hear the very ungrateful @ArsenioHall has a show that is absolutely dying in the ratings.
Really too bad!
Ask yourself: "What can I learn today that I didn't know before"?
Always be a student, always be open to new ideas.
I can't believe David Letterman has announced his retirement--he is a great guy!
@Andre_Reed83  Thanks for your nice words.
You are a real champion.
I’m pushing!
@Neilyoung- one of my favorite musicians- in my office.
I can't believe that @CNN would waste time and money with @smerconish - he has got nothing going.
Jeff Zucker must be losing his touch!
I hate what has happened to the once great @CNN.
Major League Baseball was really smart when they wouldn't let Mark Cuban buy a team.
Was it his financials or the fact that he's an asshole?
Haters and losers say I wear a wig (I don't), say I went bankrupt (I didn't), say I'm worth $3.9 billion (much more).
They know the truth!
@Lexi  Great job in winning your first of many "majors".
We are proud of you at Trump International.
Work hard - be an all time great!
Will be on Fox & Friends at 7.00 this morning - ENJOY!
Launching the Trump Home by Dorya Furniture Collection today.
It looks amazing!
It's 4.35 A.M. and I am working on a very exciting (and hopefully very good) deal - a major resort.
THE HARDER I WORK, THE LUCKIER I GET!
Saw @mcuban try to hit a ball in Lake Tahoe while I played in tournament- he’s got no talent or strength!!!!
@mcuban says he is a member of Dallas National but doesn’t play golf.
Who is a member of a golf club that doesn’t play??
No talent!
The Blue Monster at Trump National Doral in Miami is doing record business - everybody wants a piece of it.
Great reviews.
Thank you!
@garyplayer  you were great on @MikeAndMike this morning—& the Gary Player Villa at @TrumpDoral is a hot ticket.
So many people don’t understand I am a big proponent of vaccines for children—just not in one massive dose—spread them out over time.
Looking forward to speaking at Saturday's @Citizens_United @AFPhq Freedom Summit in Manchester.
Second visit to New Hampshire this year.
My @NewsRadio967 interview re Jeb Bush's absurd immigration comment & @Citizens_United @AFPhq Freedom Summit.
Really looking forward to watching The Masters this weekend - one of THE GREATEST SHOWS ON EARTH!
Into our first week of filming @ApprenticeNBC, the Celebrities are already turning up the heat.
Major fireworks!
Looking forward to promoting a pro-growth & positive message at this Saturday’s @Citizens_United @AFPhq Freedom Summit in Manchester.
Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
Entrepreneurs, always remember that every business relationship can lead to greater deals in the future.
Entrepreneurs, keep this in mind: "Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds".
Congratulations to @STEPHENATHOME - I will see you on the show!
@KAThomas212   Congratulations on joining the finest and fastest growing group of very talented people in the City.
You will be GREAT!
It's not enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what's required.
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.
The important thing is not to stop questioning..
@bubbawatson  What a great player you have turned out to be but also, what a great guy!
Congratulations on another fantastic Masters win..
@JordanSpieth  Great playing at the Masters and don't get down Jordan, you will win many tournaments and many MAJORS!
Keep working hard.
Will be doing Fox & Friends at 7 A.M. (1 hour).
ENJOY!
If the wind will not serve, take to the oars.
However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.
An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last.
Obama lied when he said “you can keep your plan,” so why would anyone believe his bogus ObamaCare enrollment numbers?!
Al Sharpton said they are "even making it more harder to register people to vote".
Which is worse, his grammar or his thoughts?
@AlexSalmond - Ireland just ended the bird killing wind farm near my great resort on the Atlantic Ocean.
The reason, would hurt tourism!
Oscar Pistorious, "the blade runner," is as guilty as O.J.  I wonder if the result will be the same?
Remember, negotiations are fluid.
Remain calm and don’t settle easily.
If you have the goods, you will ultimately win.
On top of the disrespect shown by Russia, don’t forget they still have Snowden, who has given them (& everyone) massive US secrets.
Get Snowden back from Russia—he has done tremendous damage to the US & should pay a very heavy price.
I pick the best locations- @Trump_Charlotte has incredible views of beautiful Lake Norman.
Entrepreneurs--Always remember that every day counts.
Stay focused.
Stay positive and develop momentum.
Entrepreneurs: Identify your goals, know precisely what you want to achieve.
Then study the best people in your field and learn from them.
Entrepreneurs:  Have your own vision and stick with it.
Don’t be afraid to be unique.
Don’t tread water--get out there and go for it.
Entrepreneurs:  Ask yourself "is this a blip or is it a catastrophe"?
and your equilibrium will be kept in check if/when hard times hit.
America is at a great disadvantage.
Putin is ex-KGB, Obama is a community organizer.
Unfair.
Always fun to read the @NewYorkObserver investigative piece re @AGSchneiderman, his mascara and more!
Oscar Pistorious is guilty as hell!
CBO now estimates that over 2.5M will lose jobs directly because of ObamaCare.
REPEAL now before it is too late.
Remember, if you don’t sell yourself, no one else will.
Make sure the public, friends & the business community hears about your success.
Why did Pres Obama remove sanctions against Iran prior to negotiating rather than completing successful negotiation & then remove sanctions?
I was always a big fan of Kim Novak and still am—a wonderful actress.
I will be working late into the evening closing a big real estate deal—soon to be announced.
Happy Easter and/or Holiday to all.
Remember, Russia still has Snowden.
When are we going to bring that piece of human garbage back home to stand trial?
He caused great damage!
I give Secretary of State John Kerry credit for working and trying hard, but he has zero negotiating ability!
Have to go now to sign a great and job producing deal!
Good night.
HAPPY EASTER - HAVE A GREAT DAY!
Look, Snowden is bad, done tremendous damage to our country and standing - but we have far worse in our government (guess who?
).
Huffington Post is just upset that I said its purchase by AOL has been a disaster and that Arianna Huffington is ugly both inside and out!
I will be doing Fox & Friends at 7 (15 minutes).
Enjoy it and your day!
Obama through his cronies said the Keysyone pipeline was "not political" - how much can one man lie about even the most obvious things?
Just finished another week of filming @ApprenticeNBC.
This season, a record 14th, is shaping up to be the best yet..
A storied franchise with a loyal fanbase, @buffalobills should remain in Buffalo.
The biggest winner of Obama’s ’08 win --- Vladimir Putin.
Ultimately he could be tied with Iran after Tehran becomes a nuclear power.
Obama told Medvedev after the ’12 reelect, he would “have more flexibility”.
It was music to Putin’s ears.
If America unlocked its energy potential, we would once again be the most powerful country in the world.
Washington is holding us back.
After thousands lost and spending two trillion dollars, Iraq (I told you so) is imploding.
Really dumb pols put us and kept us there-so sad!
Once the tragic mistake of going into Iraq was made, we should have at least taken the oil (or at least some of it).
Understand that difficulties, mistakes and setbacks are an inevitable part of business and life...
But always look for the opportunities.
Get the big picture--but be prepared for the picture to change.
Where there's a will, there's a win.
Think positively!
Congratulations to @bostonpolice on yesterday’s successful and safe @bostonmarathon.
The entire country is proud.

Stephen Lynch (D-Ma) said, "There's all of these taxes and fees that are the tough medicine..
it's going to hit the fan" 're ObamaCare.
The NYPD Surveillance Program kept NYC safe since 9/11.
There will be tragic consequences for ending it.
Always remember, SOMETIMES YOUR BEST INVESTMENTS ARE THE ONES YOU DON'T MAKE!
@McIlroyRory  Thanks for your nice note - they love you at Trump National Doral.
You are looking good - will have a GREAT year!
The way President Obama runs down the stairs of Air Force 1, hopping & bobbing all the way, is so inelegant and unpresidential.
Do not fall!
Interesting how President Obama is flying around in a Boeing 747 on so-called Earth Day!
On rugged Aberdeenshire coastline,@TrumpScotland’s Par 72 course is 7,400 picturesque yds.
The city of Buffalo is struggling.
Moving the @buffalobills would be catastrophic.
The Bills belong in Buffalo!
New Yorkers will get a chance to see a film for free this summer from @attnyc and @tribecafilmfest.
My choice?
No surprise Assad is not destroying his chemical weapons.
He never intended to in the first place.
The ObamaCare enrollment numbers are a lie.
South Korea is absolutely killing us on trade deals.
Their surplus vs U.S. is massive - and we pay for their protection.
WHO NEGOTIATES?
W/a newly expanded 27 holes of golfing, Trump Intl.
N.Y.Times headline states Obama suffers setbacks in Japan trade deal.
We allow Japan to sell us millions of cars with zero import tax and we can't make a trade deal with them - our country is in big trouble!
If you have passion, confidence, resilience, & vision, you could become an entrepreneur.
Isn't it ironic that China is going all in nuclear for energy while at the same time making wind turbines for others.
President Obama is losing on so many fronts, in fact all fronts, that I am concerned he will do something totally irrational.
He can't lead!
I will be doing Fox & Friends at 7.00 - will be discussing the the Donald Sterling (Clippers) MESS!
@TrumpDoral’s Red Course redesign is underway.
Will be completed in September.
Putin has shown the world what happens when America has weak leaders.
Peace Through Strength!
Is everyone enjoying ObamaCare’s 21 new 2014 taxes?
Young Entrepeneurs: Think Big, Stay Motivated & Always Remain Confident.
The Sky is the Limit.
It is amazing that after lambasting Donald Sterling on @foxandfriends, some DISHONEST press only reported my GIRLFRIEND FROM HELL statement!
A TRULY GREAT CHAMPION WILL SELDOM FAIL AND ALWAYS COME BACK.
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF GREATNESS!
It is also amazing how comments can be edited to provide statements that are used in a knowingly incorrect manner.
It’s important to listen to what people say.
“Horrible” and “disgusting” are the words I used in response to Sterling’s comments.
Dopey @ariannahuff should force her reporters to be accurate—if she has that power..
@jamieaydt  Happy Birthday Jamie!
Commissioner Adam Silver made a strong and very wise decision concerning Donald Sterling.
It will now start to cool down concerning Sterling and the Clippers.
This mess will start to fade, after litigation, into the murky past!
Wow, Vanity Fair was totally shut out at the National Magazine Awards - it got NOTHING.
Graydon Carter is a loser with bad food restaurants!
Will be doing interview on @GolfChannel at 8.00 this morning.
Will be talking about getting the great PGA Championship & Senior PGA etc.
ObamaCare not only has brought higher premiums, decreased care & loss of jobs but now .
REPEAL BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!
China will now pass our economy this year, way ahead of projections.
Pres.
Obama – China’s greatest asset!
With @VanityFair circulation and advertising revenue doing so badly, rumor has it that dopey Graydon Carter is going to resign?
He should.
Negotiations 101: The best deals you can make are the ones you walk away from...
and then get them with better terms.
Never make a concession during negotiations that could lead to more demands.
Be prudent.
Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.
Seth Myers is so unnatural and uncomfortable doing his show that you have to feel sorry for him.
Bad interviewer, marbles in his mouth!
@sethmeyers  Seth can't help it - he is really trying hard but just doesn't have what it takes.
Very awkward and insecure!
There must be a higher standard of accuracy in the media.
The reporter that called Kevin Durant "Mr. Unreliable" should be fired or, at least, apologize.
He is a truly great player and a winner!
Floyd Mayweather is being beaten up badly through 10 rounds by Marcos Maidana, but announcers say it is even.
TWO ROUNDS LEFT.
Mayweather is getting absolutely killed!
Fight is over - Mayweather lost big - but lets see what judges say!
NO WAY, JUDGES SAY MAYWEATHER WON.
INVESTIGATION SHOULD TAKE PLACE.
FIX?
The Mayweather decision is a disgrace!
Crowd is booing the hell out of that phony decision - place is angry and going wild.
Fight was not even close!
DISGUSTING.
No wonder boxing is close to dead!
The ring announcers are working hard to justify the Mayweather victory.
They should be ashamed of themselves!
A TOTAL JOKE.
I will be doing Fox & Friends in 10 minutes at 7.00.
Many things to talk about!
Congrats to Barack Obama on April’s job report.
Over 800,000 left the work force w/average hourly wages & weekly hours staying flat.
Bad!
Over 90% of American workers could lose their healthcare by 2020 thanks to ObamaCare.
Repeal before it is too late!
This guy @sethmeyers can’t do a simple interview—saw him the other night stumbling & mumbling while trying to interview a guest.
Just had a great legal victory in Ft.
Lauderdale -- won trial --  now will receive tremendous $ in legal fees from losers.
Love it!
Aside from having no ratings, sleazy Ed Schultz lied about what I said.
Do not look for approval except for the consciousness of doing your best.
The road to success is always under construction.
We will never have great national security in the age of computers - too many brilliant nerds can break codes (the old days were better).
Won $5,000,000 against Miss Pennsylvania, Sheena Monnin, for her terrible and untrue statements about Miss USA Pageant.
Not a nice person!
Either Miss Pennsylvania will pay, her father will pay or her lawyers will pay.
She hurt many people!
Congratulations to @thomtillis on winning @NCGOP Senate primary.
Time for the party to unite and defeat ObamaCare advocate Kay Hagan!
Great decision by @SpeakerBoehner in placing @TGowdySC as chairman of the Benghazi select committee.
Gowdy is a seasoned prosecutor.
Russia is on the move in the Ukraine, Iran is nuking up & Libya is run by Al Qaeda, yet Obama is busy issuing ‘climate change” warnings.
Crazy Dennis Rodman is saying I wanted to go to North Korea with him.
Never discussed, no interest, last place on Earth I want to go to.
Dennis Rodman was either drunk or on drugs (delusional) when he said I wanted to go to North Korea with him.
Glad I fired him on Apprentice!
The global warming we should be worried about is the global warming caused by NUCLEAR WEAPONS in the hands of crazy or incompetent leaders!
Young entrepreneurs –  Remember that your first deals are the most important of your career.
Win & gain confidence.
Also, the more desperate you are to close a deal the less likely it will happen.
Stay calm and focused on your ultimate goals.
Be smart!
Remember, if you do not promote yourself no one else will.
When you have success, let people know about it.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
I am watching the NFL DRAFT, will be interesting!
A lot of talent but only a few will become STARS.
I think somebody should pick Johnny Football - he will be a star.
Great pick by Buffalo - Sammy Watkins will be GREAT!
Teams are making a big mistake not taking Johnny Manziel - he is going to be really good (and exciting to watch).
Cleveland just made a very wise decision - congrats!
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
Dennis—Thank you for being honest.
Somebody put words in your mouth & you wouldn’t take it.
Great!
Must read f/@ weeklystandard by @JayCostTWS: “Obamacare Myth-Making - Five phony success stories”.
Obama told his donors this past week “public opinion” is on his side.
Don't believe that one either.
Rosie O'Donnell just said she felt "shame" at being fat-not politically correct!
She killed Star Jones for weight loss surgery, just had it!
Time Warner cable out AGAIN in Manhattan - no television.
They have a real problem!
It is wonderful to be in beautiful Doonbeg touring @Trump_Ireland.
If you can’t handle the hard times that come with business then you will never be able to celebrate the successes.
Focus & Stay Positive.
Just spent two days in Ireland at Trump International Golf Links & Hotel -- absolutely magnificent.
Heading to Scotland to check out Turnberry & Trump Int'l Golf Links, Scotland.
Then heading to Dubai  @DamacOfficial, a great company.
Do your homework.
Wasting other people’s time due to poor planning or thoughtlessness leaves a bad impression.
The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary.
Can you conquer the Blue Monster?
If you are steadfast in your efforts, critics will be harmless.
Achievers move forward, and achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
Don't wait for dire circumstances to test your quick-thinking ability.
Be on alert at all times.
Be a cautious optimist.
Call it positive thinking with a lot of reality checks.
Be a yardstick of quality.
Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.
Advice from my mother, Mary MacLeod Trump: "Trust in God and be true to yourself".
Advice from my father, Fred C. Trump:  "Know everything you can about what you're doing".
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
I am in Scotland checking on my developments in Aberdeen and Turnberry.
Just left Ireland, property will be great.
ALWAYS CHECKING!
Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
Sorry, for all of the millions of people who long to hear my brilliant words of wisdom on Fox & Friends on Monday A.M., no go - in Dubai.
NobamaCare won't work, never will work and can't work - it is a total waste of time and energy except that it is hurting people (& economy!
Amazing five days - developments in Aberdeen, Turnberry (Scotland) and Ireland are fantastic - the best anywhere in the WORLD.
A lot of fun!
So stupid!
I will be heading to Dubai where I am doing a GREAT project with Damac - will be a massive success!
I really like Jay Z but there is trouble in paradise.
When his wife's sister starts whacking him, not good!
No help from B leads to a mess.
I am in Dubai with Damac.
PLACE IS BOOMING - AMAZING!
Major news conference in two hours.
Announcing luxury villas and major golf course.
I cannot believe how well certain areas are doing relative to the U.S. There is no reason for this other than poor leadership.
Getting ready for the big news conference in Dubai.
It should all be happening in the U.S., but it isn't - SAD!
We must stop releasing hard core criminals all over the United States.
Our country must be strong again!
The roads and sidewalks, airports and bridges, are perfect in Dubai.
Everything looks clean & strong.
In U.S.,  everything is falling apart!
Hitting the first ball at Trump International Dubai, 272 right down the middle.
With @ivankatrump and the Chairman of DAMAC in Dubai.
Entrepreneurs: Get a momentum going.
Listen, apply, then move forward.
Do not procrastinate.
See opportunity as the perk that it is.
Entrepreneurs:  Stay focused and be tenacious.
Pay attention to people who know what they're talking about.
Stay fixed on your goals!
Entrepreneurs:  See yourself as victorious--and the best way to be victorious is to be passionate.
Find something you love doing!
A classic - China just signs massive oil and gas deal with Russia giving Russia plenty of ammo to continue laughing in U.S. face.
Remember, China is not a friend of the United States!
Going now to make a major speech before some of the world's biggest investors in Dubai!
Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.
Entrepreneurs: Do your best to your utmost ability every day.
Make that your standard.
Just returned from Ireland, Scotland and Dubai.
Amazing trip, great places--but always good to be back.
Persistence is a key for success.
Don’t give up.
Continue to Think Big and you will be able to close deals.
Talent is cheaper than table salt.
What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work.
I have been watching and loving the United States for many years and have NEVER seen it look weaker or less effective!
Thx, and from a better quotation source: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take".
Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.
Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.
Don't ever get down on yourself, just keep fighting - in the end, you WIN!
Congrats to @Team_Mitch on winning a spirited primary.
Great job, Mitch.
Obama's wind turbines kill “13-39 million birds and bats every year!
Very excited to be addressing the @RepLeadConf next Friday in New Orleans.
There is much to discuss!
Remember our brave men & women who have fallen protecting our country this Memorial Day!
The VA scandal shows the fatal ineptitude of big central planning government.
When will we learn?
The Obama administration gives better medical care to Al Qaeda at Gitmo than to our vets.
Have a great and peaceful Memorial Day - but remember, there are people out there who don't want us to have peace.
WE MUST BE STRONG!!!!
@McIlroyRory - Way to go Rory, fantastic victory!
@pgaofamerica A really great tournament, congrats to Monty, Pete B and Ted Bishop.
FANTASTIC JOB!
What does.
Obama know about the VA or business - nothing, just look at the five billion dollar ObamaCare website.
We need a real leader!
I am speaking today at the National Press Club, totally sold out, and will then be inspecting The Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue!
Winners never quit and quitters never win.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.
The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
The Amateur.
On his trip to Afghanistan, our commander-in-chief disclosed the CIA Chief’s name.
Unsafe disaster!
The Boston Bomber got immediate emergency surgery for a gunshot yet our vets die on waiting lines at the VA.
We must do better!
The Blue Monster is celebrated in June issue of Robb Report as the Best of the Best winner in Golf Course Category.
Like it or not, Edward Snowden is a SPY and should be tried as a SPY!
Thank you for all of the really nice comments and reviews concerning my speech today at the National Press Club.
It was my great honor!
Focus on your goals, not your problems.
And remember--problems are a mind exercise--so enjoy the challenge.
Entrepreneurs: Be prepared and be tough.
Cover your bases!
There are a lot of ups and downs, but you can ride them out if you're prepared.
Snowden is a liar.
and a fraud!
Our vets are the pride of our nation.
The VA scandal is a disgrace.
Our country is on the precipice.
Washington is broken.
Where is the leadership?
The American worker is being victimized by our trade policies.
We need smart trade which can only be accomplished by smart dealmakers..
Snowden is a traitor and a disgrace.
Make no mistake, he is no hero.
In fact he is a coward who should come back & face justice.
I am in Toronto checking the great Trump International Hotel - highest rated hotel in Canada.
It is a beauty!
President Obama created a VERY BAD precedent by handing over five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt.
Bowe Bergdahl.
Another U.S. loss!
The U.S. cannot negotiate with terrorists.
It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved, but this can only lead to disaster.
At some point Sgt.
Bergdahl will have to explain his capture.
In 2009 he simply wandered off his base without a weapon.
Many questions!
The statement about leaving the base came directly from CBS Evening News..
@ArsenioHall just got “fired”—the people spoke, ratings were terrible.
The Apprentice brought him back from the dead, but he blew it!
Entrepreneurs:  If you cannot handle the tough times, you will never be successful in business.
Stay positive & stay strong!
Entrepreneurs: Keep your momentum going!
It's a big factor in sustaining your success.
Keep moving forward!
That the Obama administration didn't know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic!
Only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for Bergdahl.
Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to.
Solders died looking for him.
U.S. should NEVER have made the deal!
PUNISHMENT?
Great deal, we swap 5 killer terrorists for a U.S. military deserter.
That’s how the U.S. negotiates nowadays.
President said we would never leave a soldier behind.
How about the 4 who died in Benghazi?
Because of our terrible leaders, it is now open season on every American throughout the world.
Terrorists are thrilled.
Be sure to buy this month’s @AmSpec magazine.
Read “A Trump Card,” my interview with Jeffrey Lord.
Obama’s war on coal is killing American jobs, making us more energy dependent on our enemies & creating a great business disadvantage.
Moving forward f/tonight’s competitive primaries, it is crucial that the Tea Party & @GOP remain united towards November.
Take the Senate!
It would be nice if our commander-in-chief was as concerned for our Veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens.
Our President is a great embarrassment to the U.S. How could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap?
The five Taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now.
They are saying how dumb U.S. is!
Rapidly failing @VanityFair magazine hits me for my strong stance against Obama's "brilliant" 5 killers for 1 deserter trade.
Amazing!
@newsbusters  Thank you for a great and very accurate story - well done!
Was Susan Rice told to lie about Bergdahl?
Obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything, from ObamaCare to a deserter.
Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence?
Obama never consulted with Congress about a prisoner exchange.
HE BROKE THE LAW AND SHOULD BE TRIED.
OUR PRESIDENT IS A TOTAL DISASTER!
Chris McDaniel looks like he will win in Mississippi - GREAT NEWS and big victory for Tea Party!
I hope we never find life on other planets because there's no doubt that the U.S. Government will start sending them money!
@TrumpLasVegas' 7th floor provides the most urbane feel in Las Vegas w/private air-conditioned cabanas & a massive 110 ft.
heated pool.
Obama betrays Israel yet again, our strongest ally in the Middle East.
He will recognize Hamas, breaking long standing US policy.
Obama can release 5 senior Taliban for a deserter but can’t make Mexico release decorated Marine Sgt.
Andrew Tahmooressi.
Congratulations to @joniernst on her impressive @IowaGOP primary win last night..
Trump Collection’s summer line, exclusively available @Macys, is the pinnacle of style & prestige.
Dress your best!
I believe that in addition to the 5 terrorist leaders President Obama gave up for Bergdahl, a great deal of CASH was also given.
So stupid!
BREAKING NEWS:  Obama has just made a trade with Russia.
They get Florida, California & our gold supply.
We get borscht & a bottle of vodka.
Obama is, without question, the WORST EVER president.
I predict he will now do something really bad and totally stupid to show manhood!
Will be in Louisiana for the Miss USA Pageant which will be on NBC on Sunday night..
@AndrewKreig   Thank you Andrew -  so correct!
The owner of California Gold just made a jerk (fool) out of himself.
Just smile and congrat the winner.
His wife was visibly embarrassed!
I am in Baton Rouge where the Miss USA Pageant will be shown live on NBC on Sunday night for 3 hours starting at 8 P.M. INCREDIBLE SHOW!
Just toured Baton Rouge, Louisiana - GREAT PEOPLE, fantastic place, doing really well.
Miss USA Pageant totally sold out.
By the end of this year China will be the number one economic power on earth and the U.S. will owe 20 trillion dollars, much of it to China!
The same "brilliant" negotiators that gave up five Taliban leaders for one traitor  are now making trade deals with China & others.
No president in history has lied to the American people more than President Obama - in fact, it is not even close!
The Miss U.S.A. pageant will be amazing tonight.
To be politically incorrect, the girls (women) are REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
NBC at 8 PM.
The man made "climate change" that our "great" president should be focused on is of the NUCLEAR variety brought upon us because of weakness!
Heading over to the Miss USA Pageant.
The young women participating are amazing and accomplished.
Competition is very tough.
ENJOY THE SHOW!
Negotiation tip: View any conflict as an opportunity -- this will expand your mind as well as your horizons.
Persistence can go a long way.
Negotiation is an art.
Treat it like one.
Be open to change--it's another word for innovation.
Negotiation tip: Know exactly what you want and focus on that.
Trust your instincts, even after you've honed your skills..
@mdamelincourt  Thanks M, you are doing a great job at Trump Toronto!
Five U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan by so-called friendly fire.
What are we doing?
I told you so a long time ago: Iraq just lost second largest city as their soldiers drop their guns and run.
Only the beginning!
OIL.
What I am saying is that we never should have been in Iraq in the first place.
Bush was terrible, Obama is worse!
Make America GREAT again.
Tea Party takes down Eric Cantor - REALLY BIG WIN!
As I have said, the Tea Party is alive and well and fighting hard for the USA.
BIG WIN TODAY!
Eric Cantor's concession speech was ridiculous - acted like nothing had just happened.
WE NEED REAL LEADERS!
Iraq is far worse and of more danger to the U.S. now than it ever was under Saddam Hussein - and this after $2 trillion and so many lives!
Congratulations to @BretBaier on the immediate & tremendous success of his book ‘Special Heart.
’ Already in its third printing!
The 5-star @Trump_Ireland graces over 500 acres fronting 2.
The @GOP primary voter spoke last night in VA-7 & @DaveBratVA7th won going away.
Now the party MUST stand behind him!
Unity Unity Unity!
Shameful.
We are what we repeatedly do.
Excellence, therefore, is not an act but a habit.
A former Miss New York is the designer behind the swimsuits featured in Sunday’s Miss USA pageant—beautiful!
BTW The Miss USA pageant was the highest rated non-sports telecast on the Big 4 networks.
Congrats to our newly crowned @Nia_Sanchez_!
Someone just asked me, who is my favorite Donald Trump impersonator?
Iraq is falling apart fast - two trillion dollars and so many deaths - Bush got us in and Obama took far too long to get us out!
Iraq told us to get out, Iraq is now falling, and Iraq now wants us to come back!
Don't do it unless we get the OIL, and I mean ALL OF IT!
I told all of the haters and losers long ago that Iraq would fall, take the OIL or get out fast!
People are LOVING the Trump sign on the Chicago building.
In answer to your questions about my favorite impersonator, the answer is Darrell Hammond.
Before I bought the site, the Sun Times had the biggest, ugliest sign Chicago has ever seen.
Mine is magnificent and popular.
Dopey @chicagotribune critic fails to mention the ugly Sun Times sign.
We should never have gone into Iraq but, once in, should have gotten out a lot faster.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Iraqi Army is useless.
President Obama, stay the hell out of Iraq (we should never have been there in the first place)..
Thank you @Todayshow for the wonderful and honest poll results on Chicago sign.
People love it!
Had a great time yesterday on @theviewtv with @WhoopiGoldberg, @JennyMcCarthy,  @SherriEShepherd & guest host @MrJerryOC!
Jailed USMC Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi should be released immediately.
Since when does Mexico care about border security?
W/ the ransom Obama paid for deserter Bergdhal, getting Mexico to release USMC Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi is much harder.
If you want to be successful in business, you must take risks.
Make sure each risk is calculated and can have a positive fallback.
Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out.
Actually, they will take over Iraq and all of their oil.
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close!
Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left.
What a terrible waste of lives and money!
@MattGinellaGC  It's true Matt, the NEW "Blue Monster" is better than Pinehurst, so is Bedminster.
Turnberry & Trump Aberdeen blow it away!
@MattGinellaGC  Have you ever seen Trump National/Bedminster or Trump International Golf links in Scotland.
Both far better than Pinehurst!
I would like to wish all fathers, even the haters and losers, a very happy Fathers Day..
@HollySandersGC.
Remember, it was Martin K who sank the big ten footer to win the Ryder Cup.
He can handle the pressure!
I'd bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings.
This is not what golf is about!
Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst.
Big announcement tomorrow morning concerning the great Turnberry Resort in Scotland!
Will be doing Fox & Friends at 7 - 2 minutes.
The Trump Organization Finalizes Purchase of Legendary Turnberry Resort in Scotland.
The only reason I am critical of the Pinehurst look is because I’m a lover of golf—and that look on TV hurts golf badly.
If anybody else but Coore and Crenshaw designed Pinehurst they would be run out of town—(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair)!
Congratulations to @spurs on their @NBA championship.
Well-deserved.
The VA scandal will only get worse over the time.
Our vets deserve the best care possible.
We must be open to private solutions.
Turnberry- one of the most beautiful places in the world....
Iraq is no longer our problem.
We never should have been there in the first place!
When ISIS caught the soldiers, do you think they read them their legal rights prior to executing them?
Success comes with hard work, focus and luck.
The luck comes to those who seek it out.
If you are not in the game, you cannot get lucky.
I know about the “rustic” look on golf courses—but see photo of highly rated Trump National Philadelphia—a real gem.
I bought the great Turnberry Resort today - considered by many to have the greatest golf course in the World.
I will take good care of it!
It's time to let Pete Rose, the all time hits leader, into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Enough already!!!!!
I will be doing The Howard Stern Show at 7 A.M. (10 minutes).
Always fun, and interesting, talking to Howard!
With our border not being secure, Obama is giving a pathway to terrorists to enter our country.
An attack is on him.
The Trump Organization Finalizes Purchase of Legendary Turnberry Resort in Scotland.
I was right—TV ratings for US Open are way down from last year.
People don’t want to look at a burned out, ugly course!
Just met with the incoming Speaker of the Florida House, @SteveCrisafulli – a fantastic guy!
He will be a truly great leader..
AMERICA USED TO BE THE LEADER OF THE WORLD.
THANKS TO OBAMA AMERICA ISN'T EVEN LEADING FROM BEHIND.
Every poll shows high approval of the new sign on @TrumpChicago.
I am honored by the great support.
A country that cannot protect its borders is a country destined to fail.
Another broken promise by our leaders in Washington.
Will the Benghazi terrorist use the videotape as a defense?
If so, will Obama apologize to him?
US Army Reserve @leezeldin will bring Conservative solutions to DC.
Next Tuesday, vote for Lee in the NY-1 primary.
What took so long to catch only 1 of the Benghazi terrorists?
Especially after the killer has been taunting the US in the press f/2 yrs.
Manufacturing is now less than 9% of US GDP.
The Rust Belt, heart of our country’s factory sector, has been destroyed by our leaders.
Every day St. Maarten loses vital tourism dollars due to the incompetence of PM Sarah Westcot-Williams.
Mullet Bay Golf Course looks like a slum on the beautiful island of St. Maarten.
@PrimeMinisterSX  should be ashamed for allowing this.
PM Sarah Westcot-Williams incompetence should not be rewarded.
You should vote for anyone who runs against her—loser!
Resolve never to quit, never to give up, no matter what the situation..
@PrimeMinisterSX has no clue what’s going on in St. Maarten.
Mullet Bay is a third world slum.
I actually enjoyed the piece re sign @TheDailyShow.
Could it be that I’m starting to like Jon Stewart?
MUST READ!
My @chicagotribune editorial: "I love Chicago ...
and my sign"!
The @AmSpec interview by Jeffrey Lord: "A TRUMP CARD - The Donald talks politics and parenting".
Why isn't Mexico releasing our Marine.
U.S. should come down really hard on them.
I loved the day Paul Goldberger got fired (or left) as N.Y.Times architecture critic and has since faded into irrelevance.
Kamin next!
N.Y. City is paying FORTY MILLION DOLLARS to five men that many think are guilty as hell.
So many facts -  should have been trial.
Politics!
How much money are the lawyers for the Central Park Five getting out of the 40 million dollars, or are they paid  by the City (or both)?
I will be on Fox & Friends at 7 A.M. - 10 minutes.
Much to talk about, enjoy!
@Graeme_McDowell   Great playing Graeme - you are a true champion!
Do you believe that Secy.
I wonder if when Secy.
Kerry goes to Iraq and Afghanistan he pushes hard for them to look at GLOBAL WARMING and study the carbon footprint?
The dying @NYDailyNews asked me to do an Editorial on the Central Park 5 ripoff  & then they pretend it was my idea.
Loser newspaper!
The failing @NYDailyNews which just raised its prices because it’s dying, said I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t.
Dishonest.
It’s Monday.
How much will premiums rise today because of ObamaCare?
REPEAL!
Always make a total effort, even when the odds are against you.
Great going @themichellewie –you showed the world that all of that amazing talent is for real.
I hope voters in Mississippi cast their ballot for @senatormcdaniel.
He is strong, he is smart & he wants things to change in Washington.
I am the only potential owner of the @buffalobills who will keep the team in Buffalo, where it belongs!
A @senatormcdaniel win is a victory for our country.
Chris is a Constitutional Conservative who'll make a difference in Washington.
The Benghazi terrorist is getting speedier care than our Vets at the VA.
Obama has his priorities.
The 9.11.12 attack on the Benghazi consulate was a sophisticated, multi-prong wave attack.
When will all the 50+ fighters face justice?
Another cover-up.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Congrats to @leezeldin on a great victory.
I hope my robocalls helped!
Boycott Mexico until they release our Marine.
With all the money they get from the U.S., this should be an easy one.
NO RESPECT!
Now Syria is bombing Iraq and Secy.
Kerry, after we blew the hell out of the place, says please don't do that.
Syria is a front for Iran.
If you entered our country illegally and are then granted amnesty, why would you abide by other laws?
No Amnesty!
It’s Thursday.
Which brand of eyeliner is the nation’s worst AG @AGSchneiderman wearing today?
I look forward to my press conference on Weds of next week @TrumpTurnberry to discuss changes & big investment I'll make.
Very exciting!
Eli Wallach was a great actor and a great guy.
My opinion-- his performance in The Good the Bad and the Ugly was his all time best!
Secy John Kerry has a tough job but he looks so totally lost negotiating w/ those characters who are cleaning his clock.
Sad to watch...
As Iran began the process of taking over Iraq, many people wanted me to say that “I told you so!
” – so, I told you so.
Someone just wrote that “you predicted every single major event that’s now happening—and they knock you instead of giving you credit”.
Exclusively @Macys, The Donald J. Trump Signature Collection features the best ties & shirts at the best prices..
@BretBaier’s newly released book ‘Special Heart’ brings a message of hope.
After these spirited primaries are over, @GOP must be fully united for November.
If we take the Senate, we stop Obama’s agenda.
I'm leaving now for Ireland, Spain, Scotland and elsewhere--crazy life!
Our Q1 GDP was -2.9%.
Worst in memory --  ObamaCare killing jobs, stopping growth and making small business insecure.
Control your own destiny or someone else will.
Success requires 100% effort and 100% focus.
Nothing less.
Realize that persistence can go a long way.
Being stubborn is often an attribute.
Practice positive thinking--this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary, negative or detrimental.
I just arrived in Barcelona.
I make a big speech tomorrow and then off to Ireland and Scotland.
I know Shia LaBeouf @thecampaignbook and when sober, a really nice guy.
Must get act together fast before too late.
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is driving business out of New York for his own public relations benefit.
A real dope!
Ask yourself: What am I pretending not to see?
There may be some great opportunities right around you.
I am in Ireland inspecting my great and very beautiful Atlantic Ocean property.
It is one of the most spectacular hotels anywhere!
Always remember, I was the one who got Obama to release his birth certificate, or whatever that was!
Hilary couldn't, McCain couldn't.
I look forward to my press conference @TrumpTurnberry Scotland this Wednesday--lots of great people attending.
Business is a creative endeavor.
Cultivate a sense of discovery and start thinking big.
The more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know.
How can you possibly discover anything if you already know everything?
What can you learn today that you didn't know before?
Set the bar high -- do the best you possibly can.
Amazing.
People are sending letters of support for @TrumpChicago’s sign to my other properties, including even @TrumpScotland.
Thank you!
Entrepreneurs: See yourself as victorious: Look at the solution, not the problem.
Entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself.
If you don't, no one else will either.
Entrepreneurs:  Stay focused and be tenacious.
Remain fixed on your goals.
Champions aren't made in the gyms.
Champions are made from something they have deep inside them - a desire, a dream, a vision.
Trump Turnberry news conference tomorrow at noon,  Scotland time.
The place is amazing!
Achievers move forward at all times.
Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
There's nothing wrong with bringing your talents to the surface.
Having an ego and acknowledging it is a healthy choice.
I never quit trying.
I never felt that I didn't have a chance to win..
@SharkGregNorman @Trump_Charlotte Looking great love the improvements to the buildings and grounds!
not to mention course"  Thank you.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.
Do these very stupid politicians who got us involved in Iraq look bad, or what?
Everybody wants their oil - only made possible by U.S.!
Happy 4th of July to everyone,  including the haters and losers!
Let this be the day you go for your dream.
Focus, don't give up, and only accept total and complete victory.
You can do it!
Buy at the point of maximum pessimism; sell at the point of maximum optimism.
Historic Change!
Obama’s statement that illegals “can’t stay” = Obama’s promise “if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it”.
Your tax dollars well spent.
Over 1.
The immigration crisis is a horrible mess made worse by an incompetent president who doesn't have a clue.
We need new leadership FAST!
Our country will soon be relegated to THIRD WORLD status if proper decisions are not made by our president.
He was never qualified for job!
Just looked at new selection of Donald J. Trump Signature Collection ties & shirts @Macys  -- fantastic!
Would make great gifts!
Opening in 2016, @TrumpVancouver’s original twisting design will transform the skyline at 616 ft.
If only the illegals were Tea Party members then Obama would get them out of the country immediately.
We should cut off all aid to every country that does not respect our border.
Why are we giving them money in the first place?
There is only one person who should be crossing our southern border, USMC Sgt.
Tahmooressi.
Boycott Mexico?
Obama is in Texas but will not be visiting the border.
He is too busy fundraising!
Congratulations to @Yankees Derek Jeter on being named to 2014 @MLB @AllStarGame!
Obama looks exhausted and beaten.
He was never made or prepared for the job.
The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there!
@AlexSalmond I hope you played well at Royal Aberdeen but u must admit the windmill hovering over hole 14 is disgusting & inappropriate.
USMC Sgt.
Tahmooressi sacrificed for our country.
While Obama is welcoming illegals, our Marine is locked in a Mexican jail.
When will the U.S. stop sending $'s to our enemies, i.
e.
Mexico and others.
Mexico is allowing many thousands to go thru their country & to our very stupid open door.
The Mexicans are laughing at us as buses pass by.
You have to learn the rules of the game.
And then you have to play better than anyone else.
Rosie is back on the View which tells you how desperate they must be.
It is the standard short term fix and long term disaster.
Rosie is crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb - other than that I like her very much!
On June 1st..
@JustinRose99 Great playing today in the Scottish Open.
I see our practice facility is helping—use it a lot!
Mexican leadership has been laughing at us for many years but now it’s no longer laughter—it’s disbelief Mexico cannot believe what they are getting away with and have absolutely no respect for our leader.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
The three great essentials to achieve anything worth while are: Hard work, stick-to-itiveness, and common sense.
I have nothing to do with the Plaza Casino in Atlantic City.
I have not been involved with Atlantic City for many years.
Used to love A.C.!
THE HARDER YOU WORK, THE LUCKIER YOU GET!
I can't believe that 60 Minutes is right now showing our nuclear facilities for the world to see (at request of U.S. leadership).
STUPID!
Again, for all of the haters and losers, I have NOTHING to do with Atlantic City - got out a long time ago!
Record cold temperatures in July - 20 to 30 degrees colder than normal.
What the hell happened to GLOBAL WARMING?
It is a joke the amount of time that network news spends talking about the weather.
No wonder their ratings are way down!
Enough already.
Refloating the Costa Concordia for many hundreds of millions of $'s is ridiculous.
They only changed the term to CLIMATE CHANGE when the words GLOBAL WARMING didn't work anymore.
Come on people, get smart!
The new hot term that they have recently invented is POLAR VORTEX - give me a break!
Deserter Bergdahl returns to active duty as parents of brave soldiers killed looking for him grieve.
Obama trying to play this mistake down!
Can you imagine trading five really bad enemies of the U.S. for the freedom of traitor Bergdahl.
Just another bad deal!
Iran looks like it is toying with John Kerry on nuclear talks - he is begging for a deal to save face.
Negotiation is just not his thing!
Mexico sent USMC Andrew Tahmooressi back to jail after court hearing.
Mexico does not respect our border or U.S. Boycott!
It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.
Diligence is the mother of good luck.
Tremendous cold wave hits large part of U.S. Lucky they changed the name from global warming to climate change - G.W. just doesn't work!
Again, I have nothing to do with the Atlantic City closing - I have not even been there in many years.
Some press was accurate, some not!
John Cahill is highly respected in all circles—really nice to see that he’s running for New York State Attorney General.
The best vision is insight.
The acclaimed @TrumpChicago soars 92 stories high.
You’re either staying in @TrumpChicago or in its shadow.
Obama claims that he needs an extra $4B to secure the border.
Well then he should not have wasted $5B on the ObamaCare website.
If Obama is concerned about the border, he should stop vacationing.
Gov't will save millions which it can use to stop illegal migration.
Congrats to Obama & Democrats.
CBO has just announced that ObamaCare missed its uninsured target by half & program costs extra $700B+.
Winning isn't everything, but the will to win is everything..
Problems are never truly hardships to winners, & if you haven’t got any, then you must not have a business to run.
The 48,000 sq.
ft.
Adversity is a fact of life.
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.
See yourself as having a lot already, and keep your integrity intact.
It’s the best path to comprehensive success.
I will be on Fox & Friends at 7.00 (20 minutes).
Plenty of terrible and tragic news to talk about!
Too bad..
@McIlroyRory  Great job Rory - you have the heart and talent of a great champion.
Work hard and win many more!
See you at Turnberry.
The Donald J.Trump Signature Collection, exclusively available @Macys offers top styles in  menswear.
Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
Give yourself a chance--make every day a discovery.
Remember the old saying "The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know" -- it's true.
Learning is a daily challenge.
Re Negotiation: Realize that persistence can go a long way.
Being stubborn is often an attribute..
@jimmykimmel is terrific but for Obama to fly on Air Force One ($’s) to do the show in these bad times is ridiculous.
It’s Monday.
How many fundraisers will Obama hold today?
Many people have said I’m the world’s greatest writer of 140 character sentences.
Obama wanted Putin to reset.
Instead, Putin laughed at him and reloaded.
I believe that President Obama is so overwhelmed by what is happening in the U.S. and throughout the World that he has totally given up!
It takes "guts" to win!
I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present.
That's where the fun is!
ObamaCare strikes again..
Trump Int’l Palm Beach offers an award winning par 72 Championship measuring 7,326 yards.
Thanks @LilJon for coming to my defense in Rolling Stone Magazine.
As I have often said, you are a terrific guy!
You have enemies?
Good.
That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.
We are now at a time, perhaps more than ever before, when the World needs GREAT leadership!
Going to D.C. for big groundbreaking on Old Post Office site.
Will be spectacular new hotel.
Lots of jobs!
Why is Washington ready to spend billions on care for illegals while our VA is still in shambles?
Vets should be the priority.
Article: More illegals enter than people born in state each week.
Wow, Obama really put it to Israel by canceling flights there.
This puts them at a tremendous disadvantage.
Tourism and more will just stop..
@usgsa A momentous day.
Great job on Old Post Office--we will make you proud!
Today's groundbreaking at the Old Post Office Building in D.C. was amazing.
Great people, great dedication.
Obama is on yet another two-day West Coast fundraising swing.
Has to fit it in before his 15 day tax-payer funded vacation.
Less than 1% of Obama’s $4B immigration request will go towards immediate border security.
A real scam.
Enforce our laws now!
The best way to build a successful business is by results.
In the end, that is what counts.
Iran will only get stronger in Iraq with the latest civil war.
We should have taken the oil immediately after the invasion.
It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get up.
Sgt.
Thamooressi has been held in Mexico for 115 Days.
Mexico has zero respect for our border & our servicemen.
Boycott!
I had a great time in D.C. yesterday at the Trump International Hotel- OPO groundbreaking ceremony.
I say we cannot continue to let Obama fly around on Air Force 1, at a cost of millions of dollars a day, for the purpose of politics & play!
Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.
So many major problems for the U.S., and no answers by our leaders.
When will it all change?
Many of our difficulties are so easy to solve!
@TrumpScotland provides luxury accommodations & a championship Par 72 7,400 yd.
course.
Watched Gennady Golovkin @gggboxing at MSG on Saturday night.
He was fantastic--should fight @FloydMayweather!
This summer is very tough for the nation’s worst AG @AGSchneiderman.
Moreland Commission is his disaster.
Obama can sign an illegal executive action anytime for ObamaCare but he can’t fix the illegal loophole.
The Republicans owe an apology for blowing the 2012 election.
How could they lose to Obama?!
It's late in July and it is really cold outside in New York.
Where the hell is GLOBAL WARMING???
We need some fast!
Rise high in affordable luxury.
Get our Marine out of Mexico.
Obama spoke to the Mexican president last week & did not mention UMC Sgt.
Tahmooressi.
Sad!
My @FoxNews @gretawire int.
Watch – Obama will not fix the illegal immigrant loophole.
Instead he will sign another executive action giving more amnesty.
Youth unemployment is at a record high.
ObamaCare is a job destroyer which is ruining aspiring careers.
It must be repealed.
When in doubt, Obama fundraises.
He has held 393 fundraisers in six years.
Another record.
Celebrated doctor @BillCassidy will be a tremendous Senator.
Louisiana – send a Conservative to the Senate, vote for Bill this November!
@Andre_Reed83.
Congratulations Andre, you deserve it!
I can’t believe that Prime Minister @David_Cameron is giving massive subsidy to Scotland to destroy itself with windfarms.
PM @David_Cameron should be run out of office for spending so much of England’s money to subsidize windfarms in Scotland.
Obama should work on a ceasefire in Chicago as well as Gaza.
Home ownership is at a 19 year low.
If you can, buy now.
You will thank me later.
It's time for Mountain State to have a Senator who will stop Obama’s war on coal.
This November send DC a message, vote for @CapitoforWV!
In any business, there will be ups and downs.
If you can weather the rough times your success will be even greater during high times.
In order to be successful, especially to be very successful, you must have the ability to be able to handle pressure!
I support K-9’s for Warriors, a wonderful organization that trains service dogs for veterans..
Vera Coking made a big mistake in Atlantic City by turning down many millions of $’s years ago for property that just sold for $530,000.
Vera Coking saved me “mucho” money by turning down my offer—thanks Vera!
If Vera Coking had taken my millions of $’s like she should have, she would have lived for many years in Palm Beach, Florida.
Trump Int’l Palm Beach offers a spectacular course, with hill vistas, bunkers and incredible water features.
With our weakened dollar, gas will continue to rise.
Fracking is an answer to lowering energy costs.
If our border is not secure, we can expect another attack.
A country with open borders is open to the terrorists.
Ebola patient will be brought to the U.S. in a few days - now I know for sure that our  leaders are incompetent.
KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!
Stop the EBOLA patients from entering the U.S. Treat them,  at the highest level, over there.
THE UNITED STATES HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS!
Obama’s war on women.
If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing, you're right..
@David_Cameron As Prime Minister, why are you spending vast amounts of money to subsidize ugly wind turbines in Scotland that nobody wants?
The U.S. cannot allow EBOLA infected people back.
People that go to far away places to help out are great-but must suffer the consequences!
Just as I have been predicting for years, Iraq will fall to the people that hate  the U.S. the most - just outside of Baghdad".
So many lives and two trillion dollars wasted, and our worst enemies will get the 2nd largest oil reserves in the World.
The ObamaCare website is in the news again - it is turning out to cost even more than previously thought, AND IT DOESN'T WORK!
Big trouble!
If you read my last number of tweets, only one opinion can be formed - that our President, and therefore "leader," is grossly incompetent!
The U.S. must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our "borders".
Act fast!
@FrankLuntz works really hard but is a guy who just doesn't have it - a total loser!
Isis terror group has now fully taken over large sections of Iraq, and will soon have control of massive oil reserves.
I told you so.
We should have taken the oil in Iraq, and now our mortal enemies have got it, and with no opposition.
Really dumb U.S. pols!
I'm so angry!
Mayor Bill Vescio of Briarcliff  Manor, Westchester, is doing a terrible job.
Horrible roads, high taxes, housing down.
Briarcliff  Manor should get a better town manager.
Philip Zegarelli has no clue—bad roads, a total puppet of the mayor?
Focus on your goals, not your problems.
Don't tread water.
Get out there and go for it.
Achievers move forward at all times.
Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
A doctor on NBC Nightly News agreed with me-we should not bring Ebola into our country through two patients, but should bring docs to them.
The bigger problem with Ebola is all of the people coming into the U.S. from West Africa who may be infected with the disease.
STOP FLIGHTS!
Our government now imports illegal immigrants and deadly diseases.
Our leaders are inept.
Thank you, @elvisduran for dedicating your birthday today to the @EricTrumpFdn for @StJude!
It’s Tuesday.
How many fundraisers, travelling on the taxpayer dime, will Obama hold today?
The $200M in renovations of Trump Int’l Washington DC are on track.
The Old Post Office is being transformed into true luxury.
We are going through contentious primaries now but the GOP must unite.
Let’s take the Senate and stop Obama’s dangerous agenda.
Congratulations to @rushlimbaugh on his recent 26th year anniversary.
Rush has revolutionized talk radio!
Sorry haters and losers!
Think big.
Stay focused.
Be passionate.
Thanks @MickyArison for your nice statement @BLTPrimeMiami @TrumpDoral.
I just want to do as well as you have with @MiamiHEAT.
SECURE THE BORDER!
BUILD A WALL!
Learning never exhausts the mind.
Remain open to new ideas.
That's where innovation begins.
Investors are visionaries in some respects--they look beyond the present.
Vision remains vision until you focus, do the work, and bring it down to earth where it will do some good.
Young entrepreneurs – remember quality and results are the key metrics to success.
Discipline is a key ingredient for success.
It will build character, motivation and bring opportunity.
These are something I just can't buy.
ObamaCare premiums rising 13.
Sorry, I won’t be able to do @foxandfriends at 7 AM on Monday—will be in India.
What other country tells the enemy when we are going to attack like Obama is doing with ISIS.
Whatever happened to the element of surprise?
Iraq is more dangerous today than any time under Saddam.
War was a mistake, as I said from the very beginning.
Obama will send troops back into Iraq combat zone.
Don’t believe anything he says.
Just covering for his mistakes.
The World as we know it is falling apart.
Much of the blame can be attributed to the fact that the United States is no longer respected!
We need a President who isn't a laughing stock to the entire World.
We need a truly great leader, a genius at strategy and winning.
Respect!
Sorry, won't be doing Fox & Friends this morning - will be in India on a couple of major business deals!
The secret of getting ahead is getting started...
Robin Williams was a truly wonderful actor & comedian.
One of the few people who could make me laugh.
Very tragic.
Just watched Full Metal Jacket, can't believe R. Lee Ermey didn't win the Academy Award as the drill sergeant.
Political nominations!
Entrepreneurs:  Keep your momentum.
Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
Entrepreneurs: Resolve to be bigger than your problems.
Who’s the boss?
Be ready for problems.
You’ll have them every day, so keep things in perspective.
Ask yourself: Is this a blip or is it a catastrophe?
I just had an amazing day in Mumbai, India.
Building an almost 80 story building, super luxury, which is doing great!
Press is going wild.
Such amazing people in India.
This trip is very enlightening!
Just started building one of the great hotels of the World in Washington, D.C., the site of the Old Post Office.
Will be amazing - JOBS!

Keep the big picture in mind.
There are always opportunities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.

Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Re Negotiation: Know exactly what you want & focus on that.
View conflict as an opportunity--this will expand your mind and your horizons.
Re Negotiation: Patience is an enormous virtue & needs to be cultivated for successful negotiations on any level.
Re Negotiation: Persistence can go a long way.
Being stubborn can be good.
The key is to know when to loosen up.
ISIS made a big mistake with the beheading of the reporter.
Even people against intervention want them blown into oblivion.
LEADERSHIP!
Our politically correct country will read the ISIS terrorists who beheaded the reporter their Miranda Rights prior to good food & care!
On 800 beautiful acres in Miami, @TrumpDoral boasts 100,000 sq.

The Trump Signature Collection, exclusively available @Macys offers high end fashion for men.
Dress your best.
The Greater Miami area and numerous others are fighting hard to get the Miss Universe Pageant.
A decision will be made very soon!
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel seems so lost and, frankly, dumb.
He can't even speak properly.
Poor leader in these very dangerous times!
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7.
That Seth Meyers is hosting the Emmy Awards is a total joke.
He is very awkward with  almost no talent.
Marbles in his mouth!
We will now be helping Syria and Iran by attacking ISIS - ironic, isn't it!
Once the ISIS thug who beheaded Foley is identified 100%, he should be bunker busted to hell.
Obama’s motto: If I don’t go on tax payer funded vacations & constantly fundraise then the terrorists win.
Obama sent weapons through Benghazi to ISIS yet he is holding up shipments to Israel.
What is he thinking?
@SenScottBrown is the most competitive GOP option against Obama’s amnesty loving @SenatorSheehan.
He can win!
Emmy Awards show was terrible last night.
Same shows winning over and over again (politics).
Amazing race a joke.
Host Seth Meyers bombed!
With the record $200M renovations on track & budget (a miracle in DC), Trump Int’l Washington DC is being built into a national marvel.
Young entrepreneurs – be resolute in your drive for success.
Gain momentum.
Once you succeed, promote yourself!
It’s Tuesday.
How many jobs has ObamaCare cost the economy today?
A state legislator w/ a true record of accomplishments, military vet @joniernst will make a tremendous US Senator.
Iowa, send Joni to DC!
@TrumpLasVegas is Sin City’s most elite destination.
Remember, the harder you work, the luckier you get!
Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other...
Obama will grant amnesty to millions of illegals yet he has not lifted a finger for USMC Sgt.
Tahmooressi!
@bovanpelt.
Bo, I heard you were great at Trump National Westchester - I am not at all surprised.
Keep playing well, you are a winner!
Congratulations to @Graeme_McDowell and @kristinstape.
Your baby has seriously good genes, will be a champ!
We have got to get our Marine out of that disgusting Mexican jail.
Would be so easy if we had a real leader.
I will be doing the A.L.S. Ice Bucket Challenge this morning on twitter.
I have asked the reigning Miss Universe and Miss USA to do the honors.
At least I will not have to wash my hair this morning!
Enjoy.
Good luck and best wishes to my dear friend, the wonderful and very talented Joan Rivers!
Winner of Celebrity Apprentice, amazing woman.
Obama once said he “would be ignoring the law” by granting amnesty through executive action.
Now he’s about to do it.
What will Congress do?
@Joan_Rivers   Get well soon Joan - keep fighting!
What is happening in Atlantic City, casino closures, is very sad - but does anybody give me credit for getting out before its demise?
In my book, @Joan_Rivers had a lousy doctor, shoving a camera down her throat at her age.
Something went really wrong that should not have!
Remember this, the worst doctors (by far) are celebrity doctors.
If you see their names, or read about them in the newspapers, stay away!
Have you been watching how Saudi Arabia has been taunting our VERY dumb political leaders to protect them from ISIS.
Why aren't they paying?
Saudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won't, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth-$ trillion!
@WWE: He's answered the call!
Young entrepreneurs – be patient and continue to work with determination.
With hard work, success will follow.
Keep your focus!
Looking forward to being at the @RyderCupUSA announcement tonight.
No more massive injections.
Tiny children are not horses—one vaccine at a time, over time.
I am being proven right about massive vaccinations—the doctors lied.
Save our children & their future.
Entrepreneurs:  Put everything you've got into what you're doing.
Know  exactly what you want and go for it.
Nothing should be haphazard.
Entrepreneurs: Keep the big picture in mind.
There are always opportunities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
Entrepreneurs: Never give up.
Be tough.
Apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious.
Entrepreneurs:  See yourself as victorious: Look at the solution, not the problem.
Entrepreneurs: Do not view any failure as the final say for your efforts.
Learn your lessons quickly, then move on.
I'm not against vaccinations for your children, I'm against them in 1 massive dose.
Spread them out over a period of time & autism will drop!
So many people who have children with autism have thanked me—amazing response.
They know far better than fudged up reports!
I attended @Aerosmith concert last night in Newark, NJ.
Doesn’t get any better than that.
@IamStevenT was fantastic, great energy!
As we are learning the hard way both domestically & internationally, hope is not a strategy.
China continues to be on the move both technologically and militarily.
Obama is sitting by and watching.
Any American who fights w/ ISIS in Iraq or Syria should have their passport revoked.
If they try to come back in, send them to Gitmo.
Senator Landrieu, If you are a Senator representing Louisiana, then you SHOULD own a home in the state.
Send @BillCassidy to the Senate!
Joan Rivers @Joan_Rivers was an amazing woman and a great friend.
Her energy and talent were boundless.
She will be greatly missed.
In memory of Joan Rivers- watch when she became my Celebrity Apprentice- which meant so much to her!
Best of luck to @chucktodd on his @meetthepress debut this Sunday.
USMC Sgt.
Tahmooressi has now been held in Mexican jail for over 150 days.
When will Obama call for his release?
China is going to complete 59 new theme parks by 2020, over $23B in expansion.
That would take over 100 years in our country.
The ObamaCare website was hacked.
$5B dollars later and the site can’t even secure your personal information.
I'm not saying to not give vaccines, I am just saying give them small doses over a long period of time - not one massive dose for a child.
President Obama has just reached an ALL-TIME low approval rating!
Is anybody surprised?
Attention all hackers: You are hacking everything else so please hack Obama's college records (destroyed?
I just started construction of The Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. Many jobs.
Will be finest hotel in U.S. Watch it happen!
Remember, anything you read about Atlantic City has nothing to do with me.
I sold years ago and left.
Good timing but very sad!
One of the big problems facing Atlantic City are the ridiculously high real estate taxes which I fought for years before leaving.
Corruption!
I will be going to the funeral of my friend Joan Rivers today.
I got to know her really well when she became the winner of The Apprentice!
Joan Rivers had great talent, but also truly amazing stamina and drive - she would never give up or quit.
That is why she became a champion!
We just finished shooting a new season of Celebrity Apprentice and happily for all, Joan plays my advisor in two episodes.
She was great!
Getting ready to pay final respect to GREAT LADY Joan Rivers.
She could light up a room like no other!
She will be greatly missed.
I will be on Fox & Friends @foxandfriends at 7.00 A.M. (30 minutes).
Enjoy!
If amnesty is so popular according to the DC ruling class, then why is Obama delaying his executive action until after the election?
With the labor participation rate at a 36 yr.
low, over 92M Americans are out of the work force.
New poll states that a record number of Americans have lost all faith in President Obama - duh!
The Trump Signature Collection  available @Macys offers top new designs for your fall wardrobe.
Dress your best!
Fact – Obama still has not fixed the backend of the ObamaCare website.
This could be the greatest internet boondoggle in history.
Why are we giving away our entire strategy and tactics we will deploy against ISIS?
It puts our troops at a disadvantage.
In '09, Obama released the ISIS chief.
Windmills are the greatest threat in the US to both bald and golden eagles.
Media claims fictional ‘global warming’ is worse.
I made a great deal of money in Atlantic City, but left years ago when I saw so many political mistakes being made.
I have ZERO involvement!
Attention Arnold Palmer:  Happy Birthday, Arnold.
There is no one like you --The King!
If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!
I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction.
Pay up now!
Middle Eastern countries must participate militarily (no running away) and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them!
Tell Saudi Arabia and others that we want (demand!
) free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747s.
Pay up!
Can you believe that our very stupid politicians released the leader of ISIS and now we are spending billions trying to get him back!
I can't believe that the judge in the Oscar Pistorious case has found him not guilty of murder.
No one has been more guilty since O.J.!
They should have rebuilt the two buildings of the World Trade Center exactly as they were, except taller and stronger.
A better statement!
On 9/11, we pray for the victims and their families of the attack and give thanks to all who have sacrificed for justice & our freedom.
The judge in the Oscar Pistorious case is a total moron.
She said he didn't act like a killer.
This is another O.J. disaster!
The so-called ‘moderate’ Syrian rebels pledged their allegiance to ISIS after Obama’s address.
We should not be arming them!
Sen.
Kay Hagan voted for Amnesty & ObamaCare.
She is a proven liberal who recklessly goes along with Obama.
Vote @ThomTillis in November!
Secretary Kerry cannot get other nations to join us in fighting ISIS.
They are afraid and he is a poor salesman who reps a pathetic leader!
Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score.
The real excitement is playing the game!
I have nothing to do with Atlantic City-sold years ago (great timing).
For losers and haters, I NEVER went bankrupt.
I will be on Fox and Friends at.
Good luck to the people of Scotland, whatever their decision may be on Thursday.
The whole world is watching—really exciting!
Obama’s promise to build an international coalition against ISIS is already broken.
No one trusts him at home or abroad.
Congratulations to Obama on building a strong economy.
There are 49,500,000 people on food stamps.
A historic record!
If you can’t focus with unyielding resolve, then you will never be successful.
Believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals.
I left Atlantic City years ago, good timing.
Now I may buy back in, at much lower price,  to save Plaza & Taj.
They were run badly by funds!
It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City.
So many bad decisions by the pols over the years - airport, convention center, etc.
Can you believe that the U.S. will be sending 3000 troops to Africa to help with Ebola.
They will come home infected?
Does anybody notice that Atlantic City lost its magic after I left years ago.
I've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus.
Nothing less.
Entrepreneurs: Achievers move forward at all times.
Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
Entrepreneurs:  Believe in yourself.
If you don't, no one else will either.
We must immediately stop all air traffic coming from the Ebola infected areas of Africa—before it is too late.
Just met with David Perdue @Perduesenate.
He’s a fantastic guy who will fight hard against ObamaCare.
He will win!
Right To Play uses the power of play to educate and empower children facing adversity.
A great cause--check it out.
IMPORTANT - @RepMattSalmon & @RepEdRoyce will hold a hearing on Oct.
Every day Mexico continues to hold Sgt.
Tahmooressi is an insult to our country.
In order to stop the Ebola outbreak in Africa, perhaps the President should put all Africans on ObamaCare rather than sending the troops!
On Mike and Mike, @espn in two minutes!
Great article on so-called climate change, formerly known as global warming.
It was a great honor to be on @MikeAndMike on @espn.
Wow, the response was amazing!
Are the Republicans going to blow their chance to take the Senate?
Must focus on ObamaCare and amnesty.
So Obama wants to bomb ISIS in Iraq & arm them in Syria?
What is he doing!
The Iraqi army has squandered the majority of the weapons & training we gave them for 10 long years.
When will we learn?
Realize that persistence can go a long way.
Being stubborn is often an attribute.
Learn, work and think in equal proportions and you'll be going in the right direction.
The people of Scotland have spoken—a great decision.
I wish @AlexSalmond well & look forward to playing golf with him at Aberdeen!
I am convinced that if @AlexSalmond had not pushed ugly wind turbines all over Scotland, the vote would have been much better for him!
Trump Nat’l Westchester is among the most highly regarded clubs in New York.
A great place.
China's the leading exporter of Iraqi oil yet they won’t lift a finger against ISIS.
Why should we do the heavy lifting for China’s gain?
Leading by 13 over Landrieu in a @FoxNews poll, @BillCassidy will beat her in November.
The Wilson family should thank me.
Pegula overpaid for the @buffalobills because of me!
Brand new selection of Trump Signature Collection shirts and ties @Macys.
Go check them out.
Roger Goodell must stop apologizing to everyone who will listen and toughen up.
His street smart players are laughing at him and the NFL!
Why are we sending thousands of ill-trained soldiers into Ebola infested areas of Africa!
Bring the plague back to U.S.?
Obama is so stupid.
Do you believe that Obama is giving weapons to "moderate rebels" in Syria.
Isn't sure who they are.
What the hell is he doing.
What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.
They just called this the biggest scandal in U.S. sports history (GMA).
Roger looks really weak and indecisive, must put on a better front!
The NFL image is really tarnished!
Now, if the sponsors start leaving and the ratings go down, the NFL will be in big trouble.
Boring games!
Our country has become so politically correct that it has lost all sense of direction or purpose.
We are unable to move forward painlessly.
Good morning.
I will be on Fox and Friends at 7.00 (30 minutes).
Enjoy!
Briarcliff Manor Mayor Vescio is doing a terrible job.
Taxes way too high, roads in terrible condition—repave Pine Road.
From rags to riches, and back to rags!
Obama’s rollout of his ISIS war plan is another unmitigated disaster.
The Generals must be furious.
Now Obama is having our army coordinate with Iran against ISIS.
What’s next?
Why would the people of Kentucky want a rookie Senator– they have Sen.
Zegarelli and Vescio:  Pine Road looks like hell.
Must be re-paved now—very bad for town.
With Terry McAuliffe, Gov of Virginia, at the Trump Winery in Charlottesville, VA--largest on East Coast.
Someone unknown tweeted incorrectly that I'm for Sen.
Mitch @McConnellPress for speaker.
Happy New Year to all my Jewish friends celebrating the holiday.
The U.S. should not be giving away our strategy & tactics to the enemy so they can prepare.
Just go and do what you have to do!
When you’re in a fight with a bully, always throw the first punch—and don’t telegraph it—hit hard & hit fast!
@Rosie—No offense, and good luck on the new show, but remember, you started it!
I’ll bet if I didn’t harass Apple for the last 2 years about the large screen iPhone, they wouldn’t have done it—but it bends & breaks!
Watching the Ryder Cup on @GolfChannel.
Very interesting and tough matches.
Amazing sport, my favorite!
People are loving the new line of Trump ties and shirts at Macy's.
Check them out!
My friend Derek is a special athlete and special person--there is nobody like him.
Can you believe we still have not gotten our Marine out of Mexico.
He sits in prison while our PRESIDENT plays golf and makes bad decisions!
I wonder if I run for PRESIDENT, will the haters and losers vote for me knowing that I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN?
I say they will!
The animal who beheaded the woman in Oklahoma should be given a very fast trial and then the death penalty.
The same fate - beheading?
I will be on @foxandfriends Monday morning at 7.00.
A lot to talk about!
I will  be releasing the full interview with a guy named Baxter @antbaxter only to show the bias and stupidity of him and @BBCWorld.
Clowns!
Every time I speak of the haters and losers I do so with great love and affection.
They cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up!
I will be doing @foxandfriends at 7.00 (15 minutes)..
@CharlieRymerGC  Charlie, call me - we'll set up a match with Gary and Damon.
Doral now finished and doing great!
Some jerk fraudulently tweeted that his parents said I was a big inspiration to them + pls RT—out of kindness I retweeted.
Maybe I’ll sue.
I thought I was being nice to somebody re their parents.
I guess this teaches you not to be nice or trusting.
Sad!
@McIlroyRory  What a year it has been for you  -- and this weekend topped it off.
Fantastic job, see u at Doral..
@JustinRose99 The display you put on this weekend was unprecedented.
Even the best putters couldn't believe it.
You're amazing.
See u soon..
@IanJamesPoulter Great going and almost as importantly, your clothing line is selling well!
@WestwoodLee Great going this weekend.
You are a true champion!
@Graeme_McDowell  You are the toughest guy there is.
If you were a boxer you’d be the champ.
Great going!
@montgomeriefdn Your commentary this weekend was fantastic.
People love what you say and how you say it.
Patrick Reed—We are proud to have you as our champion at Doral.
Love the attitude & the play.
See you in March at the Cadillac WGC.
Johnny Miller—Great job this weekend.
Most insightful and tough.
See you at Doral.
Obama:“I will destroy ISIS” = Obama: “If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your plan”.
Jeanne Shaheen wants amnesty for illegals, placed the deciding vote for  ObamaCare & opposes the 2nd Amendment.
Vote her out in November!
It wasn't only that Obama saluted a Marine with a cup of coffee in his hand, but why the hell does he have to exit a heli holding coffee?
Excited to see @SixteenChicago’s  “elevated fine dining” explored by @USAToday @10Best!
I've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus.
Nothing less.
Get out there and go for it.
Keep your momentum.
Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
Fact--Obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the CIA or DOD.
Too busy I guess!
President Obama should stay out of the Hong Kong protests, we have enough problems in our own country!
Here we go!
I stated long ago that we should cancel all flights from West Africa.
Now we have Ebola in U.S., AND IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE!
How dumb is our president to send thousands of poorly trained and ill-equipped soldiers over to West Africa to fight Ebola.
The United States must immediately institute strong travel restrictions or Ebola will be all over the United States-a plague like no other!
The woman who is the Secret Service Director looks like she is way over her head.
Why can't the president appoint the best and the brightest?
Stop flights into the U.S. from West Africa immediately!
How is ABC Television allowed to have a show entitled "Blackish"?
Can you imagine the furor of a show, "Whiteish"!
Racism at highest level?
Our national security starts at the border.
Do you think ISIS & al-Qaeda are just in the Middle East?
Obama can attend a fundraiser every day but can’t be bothered to get briefed on national security.
Commander-in-Chief?!
We have millions in our country unemployed yet we are wasting millions arming Syrian ‘rebels.
’ What is wrong with Washington?!
Ebola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting.
Spreading all over Africa-and fast.
I just arrived at Trump National Doral in Miami where I'll spend the day checking work just completed by contractors.
This place is amazing!
The brand new hotel at Trump National Doral has the most beautiful rooms and suites in Miami.
Enjoy!
The Ebola patient who came into our country knew exactly what he was doing.
Came into contact with over 100 people.
Here we go-I told you so!
How incompetent are our leaders allowing these Ebola infected people to come into our country with all of the problems and danger entailed!
Ebola patient Duncan lied on his exit papers by saying he never came into contact with a person with Ebola.
He knew he did, and person died.
Saw Michael Jordan and Ray Allen today playing golf at Trump National Doral, the Blue Monster.
Great guys!
Really interesting, President Obama was quick to shut down flights to Isreal but is totally unwilling to shut down flights from West Africa!
Can you believe that President Obama still hasn't stopped the flights and people pouring into the U.S. from West Africa.
TERRIBLE PRESIDENT!
If Ebola is so non-contagious, how come an NBC cameraman caught it so quickly while over in West Africa?
U.S. is behaving very foolishly!
This Ebola patient Thomas Duncan, who fraudulently entered the U.S. by signing false papers, is causing havoc.
If he lives, prosecute!
Something very important, and indeed society changing, may come out of the Ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: NO SHAKING HANDS!
President Obama - close down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now, before it is too late!
What the hell is wrong with you?
President Obama, I have an idea!
Pretend that West Africa is Israel and then you will be able to stop the Ebola area flights.
The Jets just don't have it.
Time for a quarterback change!
I don't know what it is, but I'm getting totally bored watching NFL football.
Too many penalties and far too soft!
What the hell is Obama doing in allowing all of these potentially very sick people to continue entering the U.S.!
Is he stupid or arrogant?
I'm not going to be watching much NFL football anymore.
Too time consuming, too boring, too many flags and too soft.
Focus on other things!
I will be on Fox & Friends (@foxandfriends) at 7.00.
Fighting Ebola will be a topic!
Do you think crooked @AGSchneiderman will ever challenge the NFL tax status?
No—too many friends and contributors in @nfl?
@ScotGolfPodcast Work has not yet begun.
We're in the approval phase.
It will be amazing.
You will love the final result.
Obama has missed 58% of his intelligence briefings.
But our president does make 100% of his fundraisers.
Despite the ever increasing Ebola disaster, Obama refuses to stop flights from West Africa.
I can't believe Mitch McConnell isn't way up in the Kentucky polls.
Massive seniority brings so much power and status to State.
Kentucky has a chance to have the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, representing it in Washington.
Big power for State.
Just put in ad for a real estate executive: “Hard work, low pay, mean boss!
My @gretawire int.
USMC Andrew Tahmooressi should be freed immediately.
He never should have been jailed in the first place.
Weak leaders.
Be sure to enjoy the ‘50th Anniversary Chicago International Film Festival’ at @TrumpChicago, the Windy City’s top hotel!
When will Mayor Vescio and manager Zegarelli repave Pine Road in @BriarcliffManor?
It is a disgrace!
Real estate taxes are far too high @BriarcliffManor, Westchester.
A total joke how they waste money!
Replace Mayor Vescio.
I was relentless because, more often than you would think, sheer persistence is the difference between success and failure.
NEVER GIVE UP!
Obama is looking like an incompetent fool in the handling of the war against.
ISIS!
Why isn't China and Russia helping - they gain so much!
Obamacare premiums continue to rise and bend up the cross curve.
And the back-end of the website does not even work.
ISIS is advancing even against Obama’s airstrikes.
Obama is disengaged and making the Middle East even more dangerous.
Stop the flights!
Entrepreneurs: See yourself as victorious.
Look at the solution, not the problem.
My @6abc int.
China has just overtaken us as the world’s largest economy.
We are busy wasting $'s while China builds airports & skyscrapers.
The fight against ISIS starts at our border.
‘At least’ 10 ISIS have been caught crossing the Mexico border.
Build a wall!
Any American who fights with ISIS should have their passport revoked.
Take them to Gitmo for interrogation.
Obama, stop the flights to and from West Africa NOW - before it is too late!
Can't you see what's happening?
Can you be that thick (stupid)?
Even Jimmy Carter just released a statement saying that Obama doesn't have a clue.
That has to be a new low!
In a little reported event, China has just overtaken the United States as the NUMBER ONE World economic power!
Great going Washington!
The U.S. is spending fortunes at airports checking people coming in from West Africa, with uncertain results.
STOP THE FLIGHTS YOU DUMB B's!
Right now 4000 U.S. troops are stupidly heading to West Africa to help fight Ebola.
Great news from Ireland—Clare County Council turned down massive windfarm near my hotel & golf course in Doonbeg.
I have to admit @AlexSalmond is a tough, smart guy.
He is formidable by any standard!
My golf club @TrumpNationalNY in Westchester, a great place!
Congratulations to @piersmorgan on his new position as Editor-at-Large for the United States of @MailOnline!
My Apprentice champ!
Obama won’t send troops to fight jihadists, yet sends them to Liberia to contract Ebola.
He is a delusional failure.
The CDC chief just said Ebola is spreading faster than Aids.
Marines are preparing for a pandemic drill.
Stop all flights from West Africa!
The residential real estate market continues to provide opportunities for first time home owners.
Buy now if you can!
China is ripping wealth out Africa and yet, as usual, refuses to put anything back to help with Ebola.
"Let the stupid Americans do it"!
Tens of millions of dollars in airstrikes had no impact because key leaders fled after hearing ON NEWS REPORTS the strikes were coming.
I feel sorry for the 4000 soldiers who are being forced to go the West Africa to fight Ebola.
Their families are up in arms.
Not trained.
If you are interested in balancing work and pleasure, you will never succeed!
Obama is making the Ebola problem much worse than it needs to be in the U.S. by not halting flights from West Africa.
Seal the deal!
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman will probably win only because he is a Dem in NY, but what a loser!
@AGSchneiderman should remove his eyeliner, as pointed out by Cuomo, when he does his commercials!
The only reason I bid on @buffalobills was to make sure they stayed in Buffalo, where they belong.
Mission accomplished.
The @nfl ratings continue to fall every week and will keep dropping.
Boring games--too many flags--too soft!
Wow.
@nfl ratings are down big league.
Glad I didn't get the Bills.
Rather be lucky than good.
Obama: “I will control Ebola”.
= Obama: “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your healthcare plan”.
Do you notice that because of Ebola, ISIS etc.
, ObamaCare has gone to the back burner despite horrible results coming out.
A disaster!
Isn't it ridiculous, starting today, new Ebola screenings go into effect for people coming from West Africa.
Just stop the flights dummies!
Michelle Obama made a terrible mistake in Iowa.
When endorsing Bruce Braley before a large crowd, she called him Bruce Bailey seven times.
If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs. Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name, it would be the biggest story!
Remember when I said when Saddam Hussein fell - the new leader of Iraq will be meaner and tougher and hate the U.S. even more.
Welcome ISIS!
President Obama, NOW, bring our 4000 innocent and ill-trained soldiers home from West Africa, before it is too late, AND STOP THE FLIGHTS!
Here we go - A healthcare worker who treated Thomas Duncan, the man who flew into the U.S. from West Africa infected with Ebola, caught it!
I don't know if President Obama isn't stopping the flights from Ebola torn West Africa because he is stubborn, stupid, or just doesn't care!
I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7.00.
Ebola and ISIS will be topics.
Are NFL games getting boring or is it just my magnificent imagination?
In any event, I'm just not watching them much anymore!
@foxandfriends in 15 minutes!
Wow, China exports rise 15% in September.
They are laughing at USA!
The people of Buffalo should be happy Terry Pegula got the team but I hope he does better w/the Bills than he has w/the Sabres.
Good luck!
Even though I refused to pay a ridiculous price for the Buffalo Bills, I would have produced a winner.
Now that won’t happen.
The @nfl games are so boring now that actually, I’m glad I didn’t get the Bills.
Boring games, too many flags, too soft!
Think of this: After we spent $2 trillion on Iraq, Baghdad is about to be taken over by ISIS.
Trump Int'l Golf Links Scotland awarded 5 star status by Scottish Tourism chiefs.
Just finished reading a poorly written & very boring book on the General Motors Building by Vicky Ward.
Waste of time!
Happy belated birthday to Chris Wallace!
Chris does a great job every week on @FoxNewsSunday.
Like father, like son.
The military generals are fuming at Obama.
He has boxed them in against ISIS with a strategy that is destined to fail.
Sad!
If Alison Grimes can’t admit she voted for Obama, even if she is embarrassed, then you can’t trust her!
Vote @Team_Mitch!
Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.
As ISIS and Ebola spread like wildfire, the Obama administration just submitted a paper on how to stop climate change (aka global warming).
So many problems in the U.S. and leadership that is hopeless...
and now, on top of everything else, we just hit $18 trillion in debt!
If you want more, you have to require more from yourself.
Alison Grimes will protect the 'sanctity' of her Obama ballot yet admits she voted for Hillary in primary.
Hypocrite.
Vote @Team_Mitch!
We pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies.
Then we pay for his golf.
Michelle Nunn will be a solid vote for  Obama.
She supports ObamaCare & opposes 2nd Amendment.
Vote for  @Perduesenate to change things!
It's Tuesday.
@AGSchneiderman is wearing Revlon eyeliner today.
Governor Cuomo alerted all to this.
Obama still refuses to stop the flights.
Is he stubborn or just plain incompetent - I say both!
President Obama has a personal responsibility to visit & embrace all people in the US who contract Ebola!
John @CahillForAG is one of the most respected people in politics.
Dopey @AGSchneiderman is one of the least respected!
Lightweight @AGSchneiderman is driving business & jobs out of NY.
Only wants self publicity—a total loser!
My @amtalker int.
on @whoradio w/@SteveKingIA discussing my upcoming campaign visit for Steve this Sat.
Looking forward to returning to the Hawkeye state this Saturday to support my friend and strong Conservative @SteveKingIA!
Congratulations to @David_Bossie & his team @Citizens_United on their important court win for the First Amendment!
Our president could not make a proper website with $5B.
The website still does not work.
How can we feel safe about Ebola?!
Young entrepreneurs – always remember in negotiations that sometimes the best deal you make is the one you walk away from.
A nurse in Dallas who treated Ebola patient Thomas Duncan was allowed to fly to Cleveland.
She should never have been so allowed!
I can't believe that Mitt Romney would run for president again.
He had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race.
I just had a great victory against lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman.
Most of his case re Trump U. was thrown out or gutted.
It is time for the airline pilots, flight attendants and the airlines themselves to stop flights to and from West Africa.
Do it right now!
I am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with President Obama's mental health.
Why won't he stop the flights.
Psycho!
The Ebola nurse should NEVER have been allowed to fly to Cleveland and (amazing) back again.
Read about my victory against sleazebag @AGSchneiderman.
More people should fight when they’re right!
My @SteveDeaceShow interview discussing Ebola, Obama’s incompetence & my trip to Iowa for  @SteveKingIA on Sat.
I watched Russell Brand @rustyrockets on the @jimmyfallon show the other night—what the hell do people see in Russell—a major loser!
@katyperry must have been drunk when she married Russell Brand @rustyrockets – but he did send me a really nice letter of apology!
Great @FOXSports art.
by @jillpainter on Doc River’s annual golf charity event @TrumpGolfLA.
Doc is a great friend!
@katyperry  Katy, what the hell were you thinking when you married loser Russell Brand.
There is a guy who has got nothing going, a waste!
@katyperry  I watched Russell Brand and I think his mind is fried - he looks really bad.
Russell is a total joke, a dummy who is lost!
Looks like Obama will not stop the very potentially dangerous flights to and from West Africa.
What the hell is wrong with this guy?
I love seeing that Graydon Carter and @VanityFair are failing so badly.
He’s only focused on his bad food restaurants.
Very excited to be returning to Iowa tomorrow to campaign for my friend & strong Conservative leader @SteveKingIA!
Thank you Piers for the wonderful article and, also, great writing..
@piersmorgan Russell has nothing going for himself except for energy & aggression.
Without that he would be dead—a first class dummy!
@yuSiddiqui @piersmorgan @rustyrockets  I got much better—no contest—I got Melania!
The new Ebola czar will report to the WH & NSA adviser Susan Rice.
More mismanagement & duplicity with CDC.
Obama is terrible executive.
Now Michelle Nunn will not admit she voted for Obama.
Of course she did.
Nunn supports ObamaCare & is anti-Second Amendment.
If you can’t see it, you can’t make it happen.
Entrepreneurs, chase your dreams with resolute focus & determination.
Be positive!
Obama just appointed an Ebola Czar with zero experience in the medical area and zero experience in infectious disease control.
A TOTAL JOKE!
Likewise many other nations.
Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are being called racists?
Perhaps not!
If I were president Sgt.
Andrew Tahmooressi would be let out of jail with one phone call.
If not,Mexico would pay a price like never before!
I'm leaving for Iowa now - will be great!
Do you believe Obama just said that America would be "less safe" with a travel ban from West Africa.
This is the thinking of a total mad man!
I just returned from Iowa - what a beautiful state.
The people are amazing and the event for Congressman Steve King was a great success!
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7.00 - 45 minutes.
Talking about Ebola, Obama and other strange U.S. happenings!
President Obama has made one mistake after another for a very long time, and the people of the United States are just plain tired of it!
I was never a fan of Bush, in fact, he was so bad he gave us Obama!
It’s been stated that dopey NY @AGSchneiderman used cocaine while he was a state senator..
@AGSchneiderman must take a drug test immediately—make results public.
NY Attorney General cannot be a cokehead.
Congrats to @TrumpWaikiki for being named @Orbitz Best In Stay Elite Award Winner for Oahu for 2014!
Congratulations to @TrumpCollection’s @TrumpPanama for receiving the Certificate of Excellence & Top 10 Hotels in Panama from @TripAdvisor!
Has everyone forgotten our marine who now sits in a Mexican prison because we have a president too incompetent or too lazy to make a call?
Oscar Pistorius only gets five years in prison for killing his girlfriend.
Ridiculous decision!
Judge couldn't even read her own writings.
Wow, one of the all-time greats in fashion, OSCAR DE LA RENTA, has just died at 82.
Great fashion achievements but also a really nice guy!
Oscar Pistorious will likely only serve 10 months for the cold blooded murder of his girlfriend.
Another O.J. travesty.
The judge is a moron!
I will be in Washington, D.C. tomorrow to receive the 2014 Joseph Wharton Award at the Wharton Club of D.C.—a great honor!
Obama will let Ebola fly into US & drugrunners cross our border daily.
But he won't pressure Mexico on Sgt.
Tahmooressi.
Don’t believe Kay Hagan on Ebola travel ban.
She also promised that you would keep your healthcare plan under ObamaCare.
Vote @ThomTillis!
Negotiation is an art.
Treat it like one.
The U.S. accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs!
Very sad!
The United States, under President Obama, has truly become the "gang that couldn't shoot straight".
Everything he touches turns to garbage!
The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training - very unfair to them and their families!
If there is one more Ebola case in the U.S., a full travel ban will be instituted.
This common sense move should have been done long ago!
Why are we letting the three girls, who left the U.S. to join ISIS, back into the country?
How stupid has our once respected country become!
I'm going to D.C. today to check on the hotel I'm building on Penn.
AVE.
, and then being honored by the Wharton School of Finance, the BEST!
Ben Bradlee was truly one of the greats.
What an amazing life he led.
My warmest condolences to Dino & the whole family.
Later today I’m being honored at the Park Hyatt in Washington, D.C. by the Wharton Club.
The Joseph Wharton Award Dinner.
A great honor.
An interesting cartoon that is circulating.
If Mitt Romney were in the private sector & he suffered the horrendous loss of 2012, do you think he’d rehire himself for 2016?
—I don’t!
Liberal SD Dem candidate Rick Weiland wants to expand ObamaCare to single payer & opposes Ebola travel ban.
Send @RoundsforSenate to Senate!
Alison Grimes supports harsh restrictions to kill coal industry & supports Obama's anti-gun legislation.
Vote @Team_Mitch!
Tremendous pressure on President Obama to institute a travel ban on Ebola stricken West Africa.
At some point this stubborn dope will fold!
Double digit premium increases because of ObamaCare.
Dems trying to delay showing numbers until after election, but news is spreading fast!
There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola.
Touched many, bedlam!
If this doctor, who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa,has Ebola,then Obama should apologize to the American people & resign!
Ebola has been confirmed in N.Y.C., with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with.
I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa.
So simple, but he refused.
A TOTAL incompetent!
I never thought I'd say it in my lifetime, but President Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Sotoro, is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter!
President Obama has a major meeting on the N.Y.C. Ebola outbreak, with people flying in from all over the country, but decided to play golf!
President Obama, you are a complete and total disaster, but you have a chance to do something great and important: STOP THE FLIGHTS!
The Ebola doctor who just flew to N.Y. from West Africa and went on the subway, bowling and dining is a very SELFISH man-should have known!
Canadian PM Harper immediately called the Ottawa attack terrorism.
At least North America has a strong leader who lives in reality.
Michelle Nunn supports Amnesty, a weak border & ObamaCare.
She is an Obama liberal.
Send DC an independent voice.
Vote @Perduesenate!
Kay Hagan profited off of the stimulus.
She just skipped a debate.
There is ZERO margin for error on Ebola.
Are we confident in Obama when he can’t even make a website for $5 Billion?
With all that is happening with Ebola, including the doctor who so easily came back to New York, Obama still refuses to stop the flights!
I made a fortune in Atlantic City, got out years ago (great timing), and havn't been back in many years.
I would absolutely consider investing in Atlantic City again, great and hard working people, but much would have to change-taxes, regs.
There are just so many penalties and such long commercials in these NFL games that they are no longer worth watching.
Soft hitting & boring!
Will be on @foxandfriends at 7.00.
(30 minutes).
A great deal to talk about including Ebola quarantine.
Fox & Friends, going on now - enjoy!
I wonder how officials @TexasTech feel now after treating Coach Mike Leach with so little respect after their loss to @TCUFootball 82-27?
Achievers move forward at all times.
Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
Don't waste time treading water.
ObamaCare has brought skyrocketing premium increases & unaffordable deductibles which will lead to less care & job losses.
WH refused a meeting with the Israeli Defense Minister.
If only Obama hated Iran as much as he dislikes Israel.
All the governors are already backing off of the Ebola quarantines.
Bad decision that will lead to more mayhem.
John Foust is a liberal who supports ObamaCare and opposes Ebola travel ban.
Send Conservative @BarbaraComstock to Congress!
Mark Udall was the deciding vote for ObamaCare & now 250,000 Coloradans were dropped from their plans.
Vote @CoryGardner!
Keep your momentum.
Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
Success requires 100% of your focus and 100% of your effort.
Don't sell yourself short.
President Obama strongly considering a plan to bring non-U.S. citizens with Ebola to the United States for treatment.
Now I know he's nuts!
The U.S. rocket that blew-up and crashed yesterday is emblematic of the United States under Obama.
Nothing works, be it a rocket or website.
Just out - the POLAR ICE CAPS are at an all time high, the POLAR BEAR population has never been stronger.
Where the hell is global warming?
In game 7 of the World Series tonight, the Giants are making a big mistake in not starting their ace against K.C., even with two days rest.
Obama admin.
called @netanyahu "chickenshit".
Ironic since Bibi was an IDF Special Forces commando while Obama was a community organizer.
Obama will quarantine all soldiers returning from Africa for 21 days.
But he still allows all who contract Ebola into country?
Hypocrite.
Entrepreneurs: Look at the solution, not the problem.
Learn to focus on what will give results.
Entrepreneurs: Keep an open mind!
Business is a creative endeavor.
There are always opportunities and possibilities.
I told you that the Giants starting Hudson was a mistake.
Just got knocked out of the game.
I love being right!
Happy Birthday @IvankaTrump!
You are an amazing daughter!
My @NewsRadio610 int.
Mark Begich votes with Obama 97%.
He opposes drilling & supports Amnesty for illegals.
Next Tuesday, vote @DanSullivan2014!
Jeanne Shaheen was the deciding vote for ObamaCare.
Premiums have skyrocketed 90% for New Hampshire.
Send @SenScottBrown to the Senate!
Happy Halloween!
Awarded both @ForbesInspector Five-Star & @AAAFiveDiamond ratings, @TrumpNewYork’s @Jean_GeorgesNYC is fantastic.
Next Tuesday, remember how our president has not lifted a finger for USMC Tahmooressi.
He only wants illegals to cross our border.
Crazy - Election officials saying that there is nothing stopping illegal immigrants from voting.
This is very bad (unfair) for Republicans!
Many of the released Guantanamo detainees are now fighting for ISIS and other enemy groups.
We need proper leadership before it is too late!
Having a truly great imagination is often far more important than having even massive knowledge - but still, never underestimate knowledge!
The five prisoners our government so stupidly released for one pathetic traitor are now fighting and killing for ISIS-BAD DEAL!
They finally let our Marine out of a Mexican prison, no thanks to Obama.
Way too long..
@JudgeJeanine  Tonight at  9 P.M. on @FoxNews - ENJOY!
@TrumpDoral.
Thanks for the many nice statements and to the media and golf critics for the great reviews of the brand new BLUE MONSTER!
Wow, so far everyone running for office who I did a ROBOCALL for has taken the lead in the polls -- the smart pols know this.
GREAT!
Strong debate by @PerdueSenate.
No question he won.
We need more business leaders with bold vision to fix Washington.
Obama/Reid/Nunn's failed economic policies are not working.
@PerdueSenate will bring fresh perspective to solving problems..
@MattGinellaGC @GCMorningDrive  Matt will be talking about Trump National Doral tomorrow A.M. Terrific guy, looking forward to it!
@SkyscraperLive: Nick, all of the folks at Trump International next door are wishing you well.
We will block the strong winds!
@MattGinellaGC  Don't forget to watch Matt tomorrow on Morning Drive talking about The Blue Monster and Trump Doral.
I will be doing @foxandfriends this morning at 8 (not 7)..
@MattGinellaGC Thx for the nice story @TrumpDoral.
Look forward to showing you Trump Int’l in Aberdeen in the spring & Turnberry plans.
Congratulations to @SteveKingIA and his team on running a great campaign.
Steve is a strong leader in the House.
A Veteran & true Conservative, @leezeldin will make a real difference in Washington.
NY-1 GOP, GOTV for Lee tomorrow!
Very excited for @LaraLeaYunaska and @EricTrump’s wedding this weekend.
My @todayshow int.
Congratulations to @SenScottBrown on running an aggressive & fair campaign.
Vote for Scott today New Hampshire!
Today is referendum on ObamaCare, Amnesty, slow growth, having your healthcare dropped & all the other lies.
Today the Democrats lose big.
But tomorrow the Republicans must communicate a positive pro-growth agenda.
This season’s cast of  @ApprenticeNBC brings excitement to the Board Room.
Lots of surprises & great tasks.
Enjoy – Jan.
Today will be a big day @Team_Mitch for you in many ways.
The country is lucky.
Good luck to @joniernst.
You will make a wonderful Senator..
@ericbolling  Great job on The Five tonight, and not only because you were so nice to The Apprentice.
See you soon and thanks!
@Team_Mitch  Congratulations Mitch!
Looking like a really big night for Republicans - a tremendous refutation of President Obama and his failed policies!
One year ago I started calling President Obama INCOMPETENT and people thought it was too tough.
Tonight everyone is using that    word!
@FLGovScott: Amazing race, tremendous courage - you deserved this win for a very old fashioned reason - you have been a great governor!
A really bad night for President Obama.
Now the Republicans have to get together and get the job done!
@Team_Mitch   Fantastic win, we are all proud of you!
Your victory speech last night was very gracious to an opponent whose speech was not.
Had @SenScottBrown asked me to do a robo call for him, I would have done it and he would have won.
Congratulations to @CharlieCrist who has now lost a statewide election in Florida as a Republican, Independent & Democrat.
Obama has now had two record & historic midterm losses.
There is Hope & Change for America.
Yesterday was a referendum on ObamaCare & all other Obama fiascos.
Republicans can now rein him in.
I recorded robo calls for @Perduesenate, @leezeldin & @SteveKingIA.
All had record wins.
The Maryland Democrat Party attacked me with a racist flyer.
@Hogan4Governor won, 2nd GOP governor elected in 40 years.
Obama’s Amnesty Executive Order can now be stopped by Majority Leader McConnell with riders.
That’s one reason we needed the Senate.
The new Congress must restore military spending & stop Obama budget cuts.
Also, hold Obama accountable on the VA.
Fact – every successful GOP Senate candidate just elected ran on repealing ObamaCare.
In January, it’s time to move!
My @971FMTalk int.
Why did @AGSchneiderman have to fill out 3 successive ballots on Election Day?
@greta: Look forward to watching Greta's interview tonight at 7.00 P.M. with Marine Andrew Tahmooressi..
@MikeAndMike   I will be on the Mike & Mike Show at 7.05 A.M. (ESPN) - 10 minutes.
Will be fun, great guys!
Autism Speaks' Bob and Suzanne Wright will address the Pontifical Council on Health Care Workers at the Vatican in Rome.
We should immediately stop sending our beautiful American tax dollars to countries that hate us and laugh at our President’s stupidity!
We are now sending thousands of additional troops to Iraq to teach them how to fight - they will run, billions wasted!
WHAT DOES U.S. GET?
We spent TWO TRILLION DOLLARS in Iraq and got NOTHING.
Now we are going back and will again get NOTHING because our leaders are clueless!
Do not go back into Iraq unless they agree, in a signed formal instrument, to give the U.S. 50% of their oil reserves.
Make the deal dummies!
Remember, we don't get any oil from Iraq, China gets whatever ISIS hasn't already taken.
So why isn't China sending the troops?
Too smart!
I will be doing @foxandfriends at 8..
@foxandfriends in five minutes.
Enjoy!
Each and every new event space at @TrumpDoral looks stunning.
A single Ebola carrier infects 2 others at a minimum.
STOP THE FLIGHTS!
NO VISAS FROM EBOLA STRICKEN COUNTRIES!
It is my great honor to send $25,000 to Sgt.
Andrew Tahmooressi.
Congratulations to @NHGOP & @AFPFNH for winning control of the State House & Executive Council while holding State Senate.
Strong results!
My @greta int.
Thanks for all of the nice tweets re Sgt.
Tahmooressi.
Looking forward to keynoting the Nackey S. Loeb School of Communications First Amendment Awards event tomorrow in New Hampshire.
The ObamaCare website still is not complete.
$5 billion and no progress.
Scary and sad!
Congrats @SixteenChicago's @ChefLents on your Chef of the Year nom in @EaterChicago Annual Eater Awards- Vote now!
Looking forward to seeing Joe McQuaid, Curtis Barry and my many friends in the Granite State!
Congrats @Jean_GeorgesNYC for being named the 6th best hotel restaurant in the world!
Press Conference at Glasgow Prestwick Airport this Friday Nov.
Flying to New Hampshire to keynote the @LoebSchool First Amendment Award Ceremony.
Always great to visit the Granite State!
Obama’s attack  on the internet is another top down power grab.
Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine.
Will target conservative media.
Entrepreneurs: See yourself as victorious.
Look at the solution, not the problem.
Keep your focus positive.
Entrepreneurs: Set the example.
You can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering you are setting the example.
Entrepreneurs: Set the bar high.
Do the best you possibly can.
Apply your skills and talent, but above all, be tenacious.
I really enjoyed being in New Hampshire & speaking for Joe McQuaid @deucecrew & the Nackey Loeb School @LoebSchool honoring James Foley.
Left New Hampshire for Turnberry in Scotland, which I am renovating.
This place is incredible!
Looking forward to addressing @TheEconomicClub on December 15th at the Marriot Marquis Washington, DC.
So Obama's top people responsible for ObamaCare think the American Public is stupid!
All based on lies and deception!
Repubs should sue..
I will be on @foxandfriends  tomorrow morning at 7.00.
The entire country is  FREEZING - we desperately need a heavy dose of global warming, and fast!
Ice caps size reaches all time high.
I will be on @foxandfriends  in ten minutes - enjoy!
My @WMUR9 ‘Close Up’ int.
Deportations are now at a record low.
Obama manipulated the numbers to lie to the public that they were at a record high.
Secure the border!
ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber was paid over $6M with our tax dollars yet Obama only claims he ‘was some adviser.
Obama’s China ‘climate’ deal binds America with language of ‘will’ curb emissions now while China only ‘intends’ to curb in 2030.
Bad deal!
Looking for an excuse not to cook for Thanksgiving?
Just like Jonathan Gruber viciously lied & called Americans “stupid” on ObamaCare, many consultants are doing the same on Global Warming.
Chicago, don't forget tix for @EricTrumpFdn Wine Tasting Fundraiser @TrumpChicago 11/22.
Congratulations to @SixteenChicago @TrumpChicago for being honored with a @MichelinGuideChi two-star rating again this year!
ICYMI, my @foxandfriends int.
Located in Central Park, the iconic @TrumpRink is NYC’s top skating rink.
At least ObamaCare/RomneyCare architect Gruber admitted, albeit privately, that we were lied to by Obama.
Gang of Liars.
ObamaCare will continue to stop entrepreneurship, slow growth and halt research & development.
Defund, Repeal & Replace!
Entrepreneurs: always remember that deals are fluid.
Terms are always negotiable and time can be the best option for success.
There are many Jonathan Gruber types selling the global warming "stuff" - and they really do believe the American public is stupid.
For those that constantly say that “global warming” is now “climate change”—they changed the name.
If you don’t publicize your successes, your competitors will be sure to belittle them.
Get the word out!
I am no fan of Bill Cosby but never-the-less some free advice - if you are innocent, do not remain silent.
You look guilty as hell!
Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress.
I enjoyed meeting with @MattBlunt @TrumpTowerNY to discuss why our government must address currency manipulation.
Many US jobs are at stake..
@BlairKamin Sorry sucker, as usual you lose again.
You couldn't work for me for 10 seconds.
Bad critic-- great sign.
Iraq should be paying us while we fight ISIS.
Give the money to the families of our brave soldiers.
If we do not protect the rule of law then we can expect even more illegals to cross the border.
Obama’s executive amnesty is dangerous.
You don't necessarily need the best location.
What you need is the best deal.
They're going to riot in Ferguson no matter what.
If you really want to succeed, you'll have to go for it every day.
The big time isn't for slackers.
Keep up your stamina and remain curious.
Entrepreneurs:  Problems are a mind exercise.
Enjoy the challenge.
Entrepreneurs:  Keep your momentum.
Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
Trump Tower Punta del Este’s cylindrical tower redefines the essence of luxury.
Congratulations to Bill O’Brien on being named the Republican Speaker of the NH House.
Well-earned & well-deserved.
A great guy..
@aaronschock  Aaron, it was great to meet you at Trump Tower.
Also, really good job on television!
Do you think the 14 African nations that are banning West Africans from coming into their nations are racist?
Tom Brady played great today.
He is a total champ and a really nice guy, a rare combination!
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 - there is much to talk about (sadly)!
Enjoy!
Defense Sec.
Hagel has quit.
Great news for our country.
The guy didn’t have a clue—grossly outmatched by our enemies.
Congratulations to Chuck Hagel on one of the shortest tenures as Sec.
of Defense.
Another terrible appointee by Obama.
Premiering on January 4th, the 14th season of @ApprenticeNBC will have major fireworks every episode.
The Board Room is electric!
Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness.
Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
ISIS is starting its own currency.
May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal.
Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots!
Not smart.
Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!
Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!
Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening.
What were they thinking?
If you love it, own it.
President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community-they have fared so poorly under his presidency.
Happy Thanksgiving - I hope everyone can get together to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
It won't be easy, nothing is, but it can be done.
Bill Cosby is foolish, stupid, or getting bad advice in remaining silent if he is innocent.
Probably guilty!
Not a fan.
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M.  Enjoy!
THE U.S.G.A.
Boy's Junior Champion at Trump National Golf Club, Bedminster, just won The Australian Open.
Ratings way down, show irrelevant.
Why haven't they learned?
@Rosie always fails.
Rosie O’Donnell went after me again on The View in order to stir up her failing ratings.
Nothing will help her--@Rosie always fails.
Congratulations to @NYCParks on quickly repairing the Lasker Rink.
Record skaters this past Thanksgiving!
@WhoopiGoldberg Don’t let @Rosie speak badly of you or try to bring you down.
She is rude, crude & not smart.
She is not in your league.
Now Obama is keeping our soldiers in Afghanistan for at least another year.
He is losing two wars simultaneously.
Congress’ greatest card against Obama is the power of the purse.
Use it!
Obama is community organizing from the Oval Office on Ferguson today.
More riots sure to follow.
If ObamaCare should not be repealed then why has Obama & Congress exempted their staffs?
No surprise.
@Rosie is failing on @TheView.
Terrible ratings.
So sad that Burt Reynolds has lost all of his money.
I wish he came to me for advice--he would be rich as hell!
Young entrepreneurs: Your success is measured by results.
Be productive in the face of challenges.
Setbacks are not fatal.
Brainpower is the ultimate leverage.
Keep your focus intact!
Yesterday our national debt topped a record $18T.
Over 44% has accrued under Obama.
A real mess.
It’s Tuesday.
How many more ‘The View’ Execs will leak that they want @rosie gone?
Show is failing.
In the very least, Congress must defund Obama’s unconstitutional amnesty order.
The cast of the new season of apprenticenbc.
Premieres January 4th on NBC.
Ring in 2015 in downtown New York’s most elite 5 Star hotel.
Congress must pass a budget and hold Obama to it.
No more continuing resolutions and no more excuses.
Republicans soon hold both houses.
Broken borders, $18T debt, ObamaCare failing & over budget..
@Newsmax by @melaniebatley: "Donald Trump Tells Why He's Eyeing the White House.
I'll Tell You Why He Could Win".
I never gave anybody hell!
I just told the truth and they thought it was hell.
Entrepreneurs: You have to have passion.
If you love your work, success will follow.
Entrepreneurs: Believe in yourself!
If you don't, no one else will either.
I'll be on @foxandfriends this morning at 7:00.
So much to talk about!
They should close down Rolling Stone Magazine after the phony rape charge story.
University of Virginia should sue them for big bucks!
Congratulations to @TrumpPanama for being named one of the “Best of +VIP Access” hotels for 2014 by @Expedia!
The CIA report should not be released.
Puts our agents & military overseas in danger.
A propaganda tool for our enemies.
Congratulations to @BillCassidy on a decisive win this past Saturday.
Bill will be a pro-growth & pro-energy Senator.
Our country and our "leaders" are getting dumber all the time.
Now they are about to release full documentation on torture.
Wow, @GolfMagazine just rated the renovation of The Blue Monster the best of the year.
Even better they stated it may be best of all time!
@GolfMagazine is great, thanks!
Sorry, @Rosie is a mentally sick woman, a bully, a dummy and, above all, a loser.
Other than that she is just wonderful!
We're missing a lot of information on autism.
Support @AutismSpeaks' project by visiting mss.
Very sad & dangerous that soon to be ex-Intelligence Chair Dianne Feinstein released the CIA report.
Glad she is losing her Comm.
Chair.
ObamaCare continues to increase insurance premiums & raise record deductibles.
New Congress must use every tool to defund.
Glad to see RomneyCare/ObamaCare architect Gruber being eviscerated on the Hill today.
He should return all taxpayer money he was paid.
President Obama, Gruber and all of the other Obama cronies got ObamaCare passed by lies and fraudulent statements.
Courts should overturn!
RomneyCare/ObamaCare architect Gruber apologized for his comments.
He should apologize for the $2T monstrosity & return all taxpayer money.
Durst is a disaster at operating the new World Trade Center.
It takes forever for workers or visitors to get in with impossible security.
People are really unhappy with the endless security checks at the new World Trade Center.
Durst is a terrible manager.
Tenants furious!
Conde Nast made a big mistake going into the World Trade Center.
The place is a total disaster, and I feel this is only the beginning!
Entrepreneurs: View any conflict as an opportunity.
Being positive could lead you into a fortunate situation.
Entrepreneurs:  See yourself as victorious.
Look at the solution, not the problem.
And never give up!
Entrepreneurs: Cover your bases.
Know everything you can about what you're doing.
Then go with your gut.
I will miss @Letterman & doing his show.
He was always intriguing & smart.
You never knew what would happen --  but he was fair!
Obama & Democrat leaders did a great disservice by releasing the papers on torture.
The world is laughing at us—they think we are fools!
Policy towards our enemies: Hit them hard, hit them fast, hit them often & then tell them it was because they are the enemy!
Central Park’s top locale @TrumpRink is open throughout the holidays.
If America was under the threat of imminent attack, would Obama use torture or a kiss?
These Islamists chop Americans’ heads off and want to destroy us.
We should be applauding the CIA, not persecuting them.
The terrorists cut off the heads of Americans and laugh, then want to sell us the bodies for $1,000,000.
We fight over sleep deprivation!
Isn't it interesting that immediately after September 11th, everybody was asking for, and indeed demanding, torture of any kind.
No reports!
The Jets should have let them score to get the number one draft pick, who will be really good.
It will just never change for them!
Can you believe that Sony chief Amy Pascal wants to meet with Al Sharpton to seek forgiveness for her racial slurs.
Al is laughing at her!
No wonder Sony is doing so badly.
Really stupid leadership that wants Al Sharpton to help.
Watch him turn the tables on chief Amy Pascal.
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 - in 10 minutes.
HAVE A GREAT DAY ALL!
@Zagat named Christmas Day Brunch @TrumpChicago @SixteenChicago one of the best in the city!
Looking forward to tonight's conversation w/ David Rubenstein @TheEconomicClub.
The CIA deserves our praise for taking the fight to the enemy in the dark corners of the world.
The CIA perseveres, the politicians whine!
THE LAST THING THIS COUNTRY NEEDS IS ANOTHER BUSH!
Obama attacks the CIA for  waterboarding while routinely droning civilians caught in the Islamist crosshairs.
Obama has admitted that he spends his mornings watching @ESPN.
Then he plays golf, fundraises & grants amnesty to illegals.
Tweet me your New Year's resolution to make America great again!
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
I can’t believe the great @wjcarter got canned by @nytimes.
He was a fantastic reporter & really knew entertainment.
He will be missed!
Story written by a @HuffingtonPost reporter that the HuffPost refused to print.
Total bias, but we will prevail!
My @FoxNews int, with @TeamCavuto on the state of world affairs, economy, the Bushes etc..
After destroying the Middle East & our economy, the Bushes last gift was having Justice Roberts legalize ObamaCare.
No more Bushes!
We fully support @SaveCulzean in Turnberry--great for beauty & tourism.
Wind turbines are death to environment.
I'll be co-hosting @extratv tonight.
Be sure to tune in!
Premiering Jan.
Amy Pascal of Sony was totally used by Rev.
Al Sharpton.
She should be fired for stupidity.
The movie may be garbage but we can’t let a foreign country dictate to us what to watch.
Pigs get slaughtered … again.
Ft Lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after Trump trial victory.
Should have settled … Ft Lauderdale plaintiffs must pay me close to $400k in legal fees after Trump trial victory.
Not so smart after all … Man with name on Duke law library must pay me legal fees after Trump trial victory.
Obama now wants to deny due process to the police.
He’ll give all constitutional rights to the terrorists but not our cops.
If only Obama would treat @IsraeliPM @netanyahu with the same respect he awards tyrants.
Very strange & dangerous for our national security.
A Clinton already defeated a Bush.
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice & expecting a different result.
Romney was the architect of ObamaCare.
Bush’s Chief Justice legalized the monstrosity.
Notice a trend?
Be sure to set exceptional goals for your 2015 resolutions.
Push yourself, you can do it.
Think Big!
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning - Monday - at  8:00.
Much to talk about!
On @foxandfriends in two minutes!
Entrepreneurs: Realize that becoming an entrepreneur is not a group effort.
You're in charge.
Everything starts with you.
Entrepreneurs:  Use your imagination.
Use your intelligence to execute what your imagination presents to you.
Entrepreneurs: Whatever happens, you're responsible.
If it doesn't happen, you're responsible.
Entrepreneurs: Realize that fear is the exact opposite of faith.
Resolve to be bigger than your problems.
Who's the boss?
Entrepreneurs: Absorb, assess, and then act.
Don't negate your own power.
Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it.
Negotiation is an art.
Treat it like one.
Dummy Bill Maher did an advertisement for the failing New York Times where the picture of him is very sad-he looks pathetic, bloated & gone!
So many people think I will not run for President.
Wow, I wonder what the response will be if I do.
Even the haters and losers will be happy!
Merry Christmas to all - have a fantastic day, year and life!
The World, with great leadership, will become a much more beautiful place!
I will be on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 7:15" Hope you enjoy and agree!
Can the relationship between the mayor of New York City and the police force ever be fixed?
Tune in to @foxandfriends at 7:15.
Deals are my art form.
Other people paint beautifully or write poetry.
I like making deals, preferably big deals.
That's how I get my kicks.
If you're going to be thinking, you may as well think big.
Sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make.
If you can’t see it, it will never happen.
Bring your vision to fruition through perseverance and hard work.
That will build momentum..
@CoachDanMullen  Great to have you and your GREAT team at Trump National Doral.
Go out and finish your fantastic season in style!
This Sunday at 9/8C, the real playoffs begin with the premiere of @apprenticenbc!
Game on in the Boardroom...
The Trump Signature Collection, exclusively available at @Macys, tops all menswear styles.
Dress to impress!
Where’s the electability?
Jeb is losing to HRC by 13 points.
A Bush will never beat a Clinton.
Wake up @GOP!
Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.
What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate.
If you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure, stop trying to balance them.
Instead make your work more pleasurable.
Without passion you don't have energy, without energy you have nothing.
Find work that you love and the energy will be there.
In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.
To EVERYONE, including all haters and losers, HAPPY NEW YEAR.
Work hard, be smart and always remember,  WINNING TAKES CARE OF EVERYTHING!
The Mar-a-Lago Club was amazing tonight.
Everybody was there, the biggest and the hottest..
I just saw the movie "Unbroken" -- very good except I thought the ending was weak, no retribution!
And we complain about waterboarding.
I will be commenting LIVE on Sunday night (9 to 11) on TWITTER - Celebrity Apprentice will be great this season - amazing cast!
My @nbcdfw int.
Everyone is asking me to cover The Apprentice LIVE on twitter.
I will do so.
Tonight 9 to 11.
IT WILL BE A GREAT EVENING OF TELEVISION!
In less than 30 minutes- watch the season premiere of @ApprenticeNBC on NBC.
This is going to be a special season - truly great characters and cast.
You will soon see!
It's still exciting after all these years - and this cast is special!
Who do you like - hate so far?
This boardroom gets CRAZY!
How do you like the boardroom so far?
Hope you liked it.
Tune in tomorrow night at 8:00 and 9:00 for two episodes and two boardrooms!
Will be a great evening of television!
This show was taped just before the terrible Bill Cosby revelations came to light.
She still should have asked him for money-goes to charity.
I will be LIVE tweeting tomorrow (MONDAY) nights TWO shows starting at 8:00 P.M.
They are both great.
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Will be talking about many things, including The Apprentice!
Don't forget, episodes 2 and 3 of @ApprenticeNBC are on tonight at 8PM and 9PM on @NBC..
@peachespulliam at @TrumpTowerNY this afternoon- a wonderful woman.
It was an honor to donate $25K to her charity.
Remember, tonight (Monday), the second and third episodes of The Apprentice are on at 8:00 & 9:00.
Great ratings last night 18 - 49.
FUN!
Celebrity Apprentice starts in 15 minutes on NBC.
ENJOY!
I will be live tweeting!
Remember, after this, new episode starts - 5 MINUTES!
Wow, despite the switch to Monday night, @ApprenticeNBC ratings were higher than even the Sunday night show..
@kevinjonas was great but he brought the wrong person into the boardroom.
Had he brought Lorenzo in, he would not have been fired.
I look forward to going to the Land Investment Expo in Iowa on Jan.
Record crowd—sold out venue..
@JuddApatow I agree!
Thanks to our loyal viewers & fans, last night’s @ApprenticeNBC topped all the demos & grew 24% in our regular slot premiere.
Congrats to @FLGovScott on today's inauguration and having done a great job!
Looking forward to next week’s unveiling of the Red Tiger @TrumpDoral.
Congress must repeal ObamaCare.
Obama will veto while Americans continue to lose their doctors & pay rising premiums.
My condolences and prayers to the victims of the terrorist attack in Paris.
Why does Obama continue to release the worst of the worst from Gitmo?!
Look at Paris and wake up!
Congratulations to new Congressman @leezeldin being named to House Foreign Affairs Comm.
and co-chair the House Republican Israel Caucus.
If the people so violently shot down in Paris had guns, at least they would have had a fighting chance.
Isn’t it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world?
Remember, when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns!
I would like to thank @GolfMagazine for the really nice review of Trump National Doral - Best Renovation of the Year (and maybe all time).
Almost no news organizations are showing the "satirical" pictures.
Gee, I wonder why?
The media is usually so brave!
Who is paying for that tedious Smokey Bear commercial that is on all the time - enough already!
Politicians are ALL TALK, NO ACTION!

Goodnight everyone, sleep tight!
It's record cold all over the country and world - where the hell is global warming, we need some fast!

Charlie Hebdo reminds me of the "satirical" rag magazine Spy that was very dishonest and nasty and went bankrupt.
Charlie was also broke!
If the morons who killed all of those people at Charlie Hebdo would have just waited, the magazine would have folded - no money, no success!
Looking forward to keynoting the South Carolina Tea Party Convention in Myrtle Beach on Monday at 3:20PM!

If Scotland would have gone independent predicated on $100 - $150 oil, they would now be bust!
Based on new oil prices, the ugly windfarms being built in Scotland will quickly die!

Miss Israel and Miss Lebanon- "no more fighting"!
Congress, use the power of the purse.
STOP AMNESTY!
Dress your best!
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.
Just watched @Patriots Bill Belichick’s news conference.
He did a great job—smart, concise, truthful!

Just been informed by @nbc--they want to extend the run of the @ApprenticeNBC by two shows because it is doing so well.
Two hours live.
Just leaving for @LandExpo in Iowa--standing room only.
My great honor.
With oil below $50, the blighted views by windfarms of historic @CulzeanCastle will be very sad.
You have to learn the rules of the game.
And then you have to play better than anyone else.
Watch the 63rd Annual @MissUniverse Pageant tomorrow on NBC at 8PM!
Thanks to @SteveKingIA for the kind introduction at the IA Freedom Summit & congrats to @David_Bossie & @Citizens_United on a great success!
Word is that @NBCNews is firing sleepy eyes Chuck Todd in that his ratings on Meet the Press are setting record lows.
He's a real loser!
Get ready for the Apprentice tonight - TWO AMAZING EPISODES.
I will be live tweeting!
@MissUniverse ratings were great!
A big win and a wonderful night!
$ave your $.
Don’t invest in @KarlRove.
He doesn’t have a clue.
Why do people give @KarlRove contributions when they know he is a loser who has no idea how to win?
Where the hell is global warming when you need it?
Two of the best ever episodes of Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 8.
Totally vicious and crazy!
I will live tweet.
Celebrity Apprentice in 15 minutes - don't miss it!
Watch Celebrity Apprentice, on NOW!
All new @ApprenticeNBC starts right now!
As usual, the "storm of the century" was not nearly as bad as forecast.
What a waste of time, energy and money!
Wow, the final ratings for the Miss Universe Pageant show that it won in all key demos - number one on Sunday.
I have a winner!
President Obama, our great leader, wants to declare martial law in New York City as a means of helping out with the "massive" storm.
I am convinced that sleepy eyes Chuck Todd was only a placeholder for someone else at Meet the Press.
He bombed, franchise in ruins!
Apprentice = big hit.
Miss Universe = Big hit.
I always get big ratings.
If I hosted Meet the Press instead of Sleepy Eyes,a smash!
So many people have told me that I should host Meet the Press and replace the moron who is on now.
Just too busy, especially next 10 years!
@Lord_Sugar How did you enjoy Mar-a-Lago?
It was nice having you there--my people thought you were terrific!
Going over to @ABC to do LIVE  at 9:00.
Wow, I have always liked the @nypost but they have really lied when they covered me in Iowa.
Packed house, standing O, best speech!
Sad.
I guess Rupert Murdoch and the @nypost don't like Donald Trump.
Such false reporting about my big hit in Iowa.
Even my enemies said "bull".
Getting ready to go on @KellyandMichael - two great people!

Everyone is saying the bad news is that Donald Trump is going to take credit & they are right—Mitt wouldn’t have won anyway.
I will take full credit for Mitt Romney dropping out of the race—looks like he won’t be endorsing Trump any time soon.
When I broadly proclaimed Mitt “choked” – and would do it again—everybody said yeah, he’s right.
Now that Mitt is gone, all we have to do is get Bush to drop out and Trump to run—and we will win!
Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.
I hope you can go to @oreillyfactor and vote for Donald Trump in order to Make America Great Again!

Seahawks pass    was DUMBEST play in the history of football!

I wonder if Marshawn Lynch will now speak and call some  coach a moron for not allowing him to run the ball three times for one yard?

I never went bankrupt!
@davidaxelrod, use Buffet, Icahn, Sam Zell, Leon Black, Kravis, Caesars and many more when talking about using the bankruptcy laws, not me!
@davidaxelrod  I hope your book is better than the Obama second book, but it is inaccurate as it pertains to me - but no big deal, boring!
Why did @oreillyfactor give @davidaxelrod so much time to sell his third rate book.
Bill should have hit stammering David MUCH harder!

The talks between the U.S. and Iran are going on forever,  WORLD'S LONGEST NEGOTIATION.
Obama has no idea what he is doing - incompetent!
The Oscars were a great night for Mexico & why not—they are ripping off the US more than almost any other nation.
I have a lawsuit in Mexico’s corrupt court system that I won but so far can’t collect.
Don’t do business with Mexico!
The @HuffingtonPost is a total joke & laughing stock of journalism, as is gross Arianna Huffington.
They don’t report the facts!
I told everybody the Oscars were no good—Nielsen ratings confirmed, one of the lowest ratings in history.
Put the glamour, beauty & mystery back in the Oscars and the ratings will zoom.
Also, & most importantly, the Oscars need credibility.
I could fix tv talk shows that are doing poorly—there is tremendous talent out there waiting to be tapped—and nobody sees it!
The evening news broadcasts must stop talking about weather—boring and too many other topics.

I hope the Mexican judge is more honest than the Mexican businessmen who used the court system to avoid paying me the money they owe me.
Despite Mexico's interest in again hosting the Miss Universe Pageant, it will be because of Rodolfo Rosas Moya that it will never happen.
Because of Rodolfo Rosas Moya, who owes me lots of money, Mexico will never again host the Miss Universe Pageant.

Conservative leader by day, likely 2015 GRAMMY winner by night.
Washington needs common sense conservative solutions.
Let’s make America great again!
Obama’s offer to Iran will not stop Iran’s breakout capability.
It is a bad, desperate deal negotiated from weakness.
Pass sanctions!
Must read via @FoxNews by @JaySekulow: “Mr. President: Will you bring home American pastor imprisoned in Iran?
Entrepreneurs: Realize that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus.
Nothing less.
Entrepreneurs: Learn to trust yourself.
Being an entrepreneur is not a group effort.
Entrepreneurs: Practice positive thinking with a lot of reality checks.
Know that goals come with obstacles.
Oil is under $50/barrel.
Now is the time to increase sanctions against Iran, not lift them.
No deal is better than a bad deal.
Politicians are all talk and no action.
Washington can only be fixed by an outsider.
Let’s make America great again!
The Iran nuclear deal is a terrible one for the United States and the world.
That Saturday Night Live is able to joke about the Germanwings air tragedy is disgusting.
They should apologize to all of those  suffering!
Have a fantastic, beautiful and happy Easter everyone and then, when Easter is over, have great wins and triumphs in life.
Never give up!
I wish everyone, including the haters and losers, a very happy Easter!
@ShawnJohnson have a great Easter, you are a real champion!
Will be doing @foxandfriends this morning at 7:00.
ENJOY!
@RollingStone admitted their scam.
Phony @HuffingtonPost and others are no better-- total joke!
Congress must stop Obama’s reckless deal with Iran.
The framework is a pathway for Iran to develop nukes.
Looking forward to visiting @SimpsonCollege on Wednesday to discuss education.
Common Core is an attack on individual & local rights!
As dishonest as @RollingStone is I say @HuffingtonPost is worse.
Neither has much money -  sue them and put them out of business!
How much money is the  extremely unattractive (both inside and out) Arianna Huffington paying her poor ex-hubby for the use of his name?
Many journalists are honest and great - but some are knowingly dishonest and basic scum.
They should.
be weeded out!
Wow, the respected Monmouth University poll has me ahead of most Republican candidates nationwide, and most people don't think I'm running!
Leaving now - I'm spending the entire day in Iowa - great people, great state!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I had a great time in Iowa yesterday- record crowds, fantastic people!
On my way to @TrumpSoHo to receive the AAA Five Diamond Award.
Record crowd and standing ovation at Simpson College in Iowa- lots of fun, wonderful audience!
Will be doing a big interview tonight with Bret Baier at 6:00 P.M. on Fox.
Don't miss it!
I will be speaking at the NRA event today in Nashville.
Many friends will be there..
@BretBaier  I will be interviewed by Bret (on Fox) tonight at 6:00.
Watch, it will be good!
Off to Nashville and the NRA..
@ericbolling did a fantastic job on O'Reilly tonight.
Way to go Eric!
The NRA in Nashville today was amazing.
Packed house and standing ovation for Trump.
THANKS!
@BretBaier  Thank you for the very fair and highly professional segment on me tonight.
Many people watched and commented.
Heading to South Carolina now - meeting with fantastic people!
Spoke to a capacity crowd at Horry County Republican event earlier today.
South Carolina and the audience were GREAT - THANKS!
Without passion, you don't have energy; without energy, you have nothing.
Nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion!
@JohnLegere  T-Mobile service is terrible!
Why can't you do something to improve it for your customers.
I don't want it in my buildings..
@TMobile  You service is absolutely terrible - get on the ball!
Thanks @JamersonHayes, they are all total losers with nothing going for them!
@TMobile gives terrible service and has many complaints, just check..
@T-Mobile has so many service complaints - a total joke!
A great @The Masters.
The course looks so beautiful.
Fantastic for golf and television ratings!
Wow, Mitt Romney didn't  know that Rand Paul was in the race for president.
Very strange!
How do third rate talents with no smarts like @ron_fournier get so much time on television news.
Boring guy - really bad for ratings!
Will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 this morning - enjoy!
Entrepreneurs: Resolve to be bigger than your problems.
Who's the boss?
Don't negate your own power.
Entrepreneurs: In the best negotiations, everyone wins.
This is a possibility, and it's the ideal situation to strive for.
Entrepreneurs: Don't be confined by expectations.
There are no exact rules for negotiation--try to remain flexible and open to new ideas.
Marco Rubio should pick a location that has working air conditioning next time - especially when in Miami - proper plan.
Sweating profusely!
Today is April 15th, Obama’s favorite day of the year.
T-E-A.
TAXED ENOUGH ALREADY!
Part 1 of my @SpecialReport int.
Had a great time in Myrtle Beach and Charleston this past Saturday and Monday.
Looking forward to going back soon.
We have a sacred duty to care for our vets and their families.
Our Vets are owed full access to healthcare anytime & anywhere!
Our border is being breached daily by criminals.
We must build a wall & deduct costs from Mexican foreign aid!
My @TeamCavuto int.
Rodolfo Rosas Moya and his pals in Mexico owe me a lot of money.
Disgusting & slow Mexico court system.
Mexico is not a U.S. friend.
Mexico’s court system is a dishonest joke.
I am owed a lot of money & nothing happens.
Others claim they can make America great again but only one knows The Art of The Deal.
America will never be destroyed from the outside.
If we falter and lose our freedoms,it will be because we destroyed ourselves.
Jeb Bush - “I am a conservative” = Barack Obama -“If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your plan”..
kimguilfoyle - great job tonight!
Great seeing @MarianoRivera w/@realDonaldTrump at @TrumpTowerNY for @EricTrumpFdn!
The Republicans are funding ObamaCare and Amnesty.
Obama beats them.
My @FoxBusiness int.
For America to be strong again, the ways of politicians must be put in the past.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
Looking forward to speaking at 1:30PM tomorrow in Nashua at @NHGOP @FITNsummit!
Let's Make America Great Again!
@BretBaier   Why do you have George Will on your show - he's exhausted, boring and not even a little relevant!
Waste of good air-time!
I do what I do out of pure enjoyment.
Hopefully, nobody does it better.
Theres a beauty to making a great deal.
It's my canvas..
@georgewillf is perhaps the most boring political pundit on television.
Got thrown off ABC like a dog.
At Mar-a-Lago he was a total bust!
For all of the haters and losers out there sorry, I never went Bankrupt -- but I did build a world class company and employ many people!
Just returned from New Hampshire where the crowd was great-and got a beautiful standing ovation!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 - 30 minutes.
Some very interesting topics.
So much dishonest reporting (or non-reporting) in political media—an amazing experience for me.
How does failed writer and pundit like @stephenfhayes, with no success and little talent, get away with criticizing candidates..
@weeklystandard  I know your business is failing but you should try to get writers far better than @stephenfhayes.
Congratulations to @TrumpWaikiki for being selected as "Best of +VIP Access 2014" by @Expedia!
Congratulations to @TrumpSoHo for once again receiving the AAA Five Diamond Award for another year!
Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles will be the host in October for the @PGAGrandSlam.
We are getting ready to protect Saudi Arabia against Iran & others-sending ships.
How much are they going to pay us toward this protection.
We are stupidly paying Iran billions of dollars that we should not be paying.
Why isn't this part of the nuclear negotiations?
Really dumb!
As I have long been saying, South Africa is a total - and very dangerous - mess.
Just watch the evening news (when not talking weather)..
@megynkelly   Sorry, there was only one "breakout star" this weekend in New Hampshire.
Just check out the local New Hampshire media!
National Review @NRO may  be going out of business because of the really pathetic job being done by @JonahNRO.
No talent means death - sad!
@stephenfhayes: I heard you were a joke on the media panel this weekend in New Hampshire.
You just don't  have what it takes!
Glad to see that @PeteRose_14 has been hired by @FOXSports as an analyst.
Pete should be around baseball and in the Hall of Fame!
@DanaPerino wrote a wonderful book, “And the Good News is.
".
Dana has a fabulous perspective on life & politics—go get it!
Wow, really nice, and unexpected, from Ed Schultz.
Thank you, Ed!
I guess @edshow is a lot smarter than dopes like @JonahNRO & @stephenfhayes.
Oh well, both mags are dying anyway.
Wow, Hillary and Bill are in deep trouble, but don’t worry, my fellow Republicans will let them off the hook.
All talk, no action.
Government can be efficient with the right leadership.
Republicans have once again capitulated to Obama.
This time on the Iran nuclear treaty.
When will it end?
@JonahNRO You stated that I started “relentlessly tweeting like a 14-year-old girl..
”.
Horrible insult to women.
Resign now or later!
With a stupid guy like Jonah Goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me, no wonder the NRO is doing so poorly.
I’m a conservative, but the weakness of conservatives is that they destroy each other, whereas liberals unite to win.
The reason Ed Schultz said nice things about me is that I’m the only Repub who won't cut Social Security, etc.
I’ll make America rich again!
@NRO @JonahNRO  Wow, just looked at the stats for National Review.
Dying fast, doing very little business.
Save this conservative voice!
@JonahNRO  You should be totally focused on trying to save the badly failing National Review instead of focusing on me.
Work hard!
Looking forward to keynoting @ChesterfieldGOP Lincoln-Reagan Gala this Friday at The Country Club at The Highlands.
Sold out record crowd!
I'm getting The Commandant's Leadership Award from the U.S.Marines tonight at The Waldorf Astoria - a great honor!
Congratulations to the Republicans in Congress.
You are the only people Obama can out negotiate.
I want to negotiate my own, and much better, trade deals for our country.
MUST INCLUDE CURRENCY MANIPULATION (and more).
DO NOT LET PASS!
No amnesty.
Protect the rule of law!
The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an attack on America's business.
It does not  stop Japan's currency manipulation.
This is a bad deal.
Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment.
Do not pass it.
China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
This deal does not address currency manipulation.
China is laughing at us.
Do you notice that the polling establishment doesn't put me in polls, but put in folks who hardly register.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@GeraldoRivera Thanks, my champion Geraldo--and very true.
Excited to be travelling to New Hampshire on Monday.
The Granite State is a model for the country.
Live Free or Die!
Fact – while Jeb was governor & Rubio was House Majority Leader, Florida’s debt more than doubled.
Conservatives?
Why are the Republicans giving Obama fast track authority for TPP and the Iran agreement?!
Obama gets more from the GOP than his own party.
It is time for DC to protect the American worker, not grant amnesty to illegals.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
@johnhawkinsrwn  Great speaking to you today, we will speak again soon.
Congrats to great golfer @Frostpga on his big win last week.
Always been best putter.
Looking forward to giving keynote speech tonight @ChesterfieldGOP Lincoln-Reagan dinner in Virginia.
How do you take care of our people if you don't make anything?
We don't make anything.
We are rapidly losing our manufacturing to China etc.
Congratulations to @DanaPerino on your book going to number one on Amazon.
Great book - Great job!
@WayneDupreeShow  A fantastic guy!
@NRO  Not much is as "dead" or irrelevant as National Review thanks to guidance of Goldberg, a total loser!
Get some real talent or fold!
@NRO  Really important to save National Review from going out of business.
We need a true conservative voice!
@PennyPritzker Really important to cover currency manipulation in trade agreements - that's where China and others are beating us.
Best!
I don't know if Hillary will be able to run, she is a walking time bomb!
I will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine tonight on @FoxNews - Enjoy!
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends  at 7:00 - 5 minutes.
Then I head to New Hampshire, great people!
Nobody but Donald Trump will save Israel.
You are wasting your time with these politicians and political clowns.
Best!
Wow, 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore, some badly!
Where is the National Guard.
Police must get tough, and fast!
Thugs must be stopped.
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch.
Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots.
SAD!
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed, are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?
The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters "space to destroy" - another real genius!
Our country has to come together.
We have to start working with, and really liking,  each other.
The whole world is watching Baltimore.
President Obama, you have a big job to do.
Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together.
With proper leadership, it can be done!
Do it.
The best social program, by far, is a JOB!
Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader.
Hopefully there won't be any problems in Baltimore tonight.
Be calm, be cool-do not let anybody get hurt.
There is just too much to live for!
I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?
I am going to Iowa today - sold out crowds.
People don't want our country ripped-off anymore.
Must stop now!
Met a big fan today!
Incredible handheld video of the Las Vegas Strip in 1969.
The skyline looks better with @TrumpLasVegas!
They now say using the word "thug" is, like so many other words, not politically correct (even though Obama uses it).
It is racist.
BULL!
I have been a guest on The View many times when it was  successful show.
Now the show is dying for lack of ratings.
Too bad!
@NicolleDWallace is really hurting @TheView.
She is boring, predictable and has zero television "it" - show no longer has ratings, dying!
Congrats @TrumpWaikiki for winning @AmericanExpress Fine Hotels & Resorts 'Hotel Partner of The Year for 2014'  award!
@CGasparino  Good seeing you.
Keep up the great work, never stop!
Billions of dollars spent on Baltimore and it's still a total mess.
Leadership is needed, not dollars.
Our whole country is going to hell!
Why is no-one talking about the horrible murder of Ana Charle by ex-con thug West Spruill.
Gunned down on street, naked.
Why no riots here?
If the working, proud and productive people of our country don't start exerting their authority and views, the U.S. as we know it is doomed!
Entrepreneurs: Achievers move forward at all times.
Achievement is not a plateau, it's a beginning.
Entrepreneurs: Don't tread water.
Get out there and go for it.
Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.
My @KWWL int.
from @WartburgCollege discussing how politicians have failed us & Making America Great Again!
Thank you.
Thanks!
Beautiful, thank you..
@canoetravel  Also, the very obsolete, ugly and expensive wind turbines will never be build in Aberdeen.
No longer works.
Plans to build wind farm near Trump Turnberry in Scotland have been dropped.
GREAT!
@SheriffClarke  Great insight  in dealing with the media today.
You are a wonderful representative of calm and reason, a real pro!
Baltimore had a really tough night - only great leadership can solve the many inner-city problems facing our country.
Jobs, jobs, jobs!
The racial divide in our country is almost at an all-time high - and getting worse every time you turn on the television..
@FloydMayweather  Good luck tonight Floyd.
Just got back from Las Vegas.
@TrumpLasVegas Hotel was fantastic in every way, but the fight was a total waste of time.
The aggressor lost?
I am the only one that knows how to build cities - pols are all talk and no action.
Our cities need help, and fast.
They are crumbling!
I will be interviewed at 7:00 A.M. on @foxandfriends - Enjoy.
Congress was elected last November to reign Obama in, not to give him ‘fast track’ authority for bad trade deals for the American worker!
Looking forward to @David_Bossie & @RepJeffDuncan’s @Citizens_United Freed Summit in Greenville, SC this Saturday!
If elected, I will undo all of Obama’s executive orders.
I will deliver.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
Thrilled to hear that @RakutenTravelJP has awarded @TrumpWaikiki the 'Rakuten Diamond Award' for the 4th consecutive year!
Congrats!
Nobody would fight harder for free speech than me but why  taunt, over and over again, in order to provoke possible death to audience.
DUMB!
The U.S. has enough problems without publicity seekers going out and openly mocking religion in order to provoke attacks and death.
What would you do if a large group of Muslims had a very public meeting drawing horrible and mocking cartoons of Jesus?
Oh really, be cool!
Follow @TrumpNH for all the updates on my New Hampshire political activities.
Looking forward to returning to the Granite State on May 14!
Our country must get very strong and very tough - and fast, before it is too late.
We have zero leadership and never WIN!
We want victory.
I hope all of the many thousands of people who are asking me to give up so much and RUN FOR PRESIDENT will   fight hard for victory if I do!
@PamelaGeller is a total whack job who doesn't have a clue.
Don't provoke the enemy, go get them and make them pay.
No signals, just do it!
@Franklin_Graham:  Great job on @foxandfriends this morning.
You beautifully stated what most people are thinking!
Say hi to all.
The United States needs great deals - and fast.
We have to make our country rich again in order to MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN!
If I run, I will be in all the primary debates and you will see why I am the only one who can Make America Great Again!
I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.
Huckabee copied me.
Huckabee is a nice guy but will never be able to bring in the funds so as not to cut Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.
I will..
@kilmeade  It was great being with you on @foxandfriends this morning.
So many people saw and loved the piece.
Great work!
A strong military makes us respected by our allies & feared by our enemies.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
Tom Brady would have won if he was throwing a soccer ball.
He is my friend and a total winner!
I've dealt w/politicians throughout the world.
My deals are multi-faceted  transactions which involve many issues.
I know the process & win!
Thank you @ASavageNation and keep up the great work!
@nyrangers did a great job of winning tonight - played like champions!
Leaving for the GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA now to make a speech about how to MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN!
@tuckercarlson is doing a really good job on Fox, especially when talking politics.
He has come a long way fast!
My two sons, Eric & Don, have long been expert hunters & marksmen @NRA.
They go on safaris & give animals to the poor & starving villagers!
Big crowds, standing ovations in South Carolina - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
How come there are no protests in favor of the two young police officers gunned down in Mississippi by two deranged animals.
DEATH PENALTY!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 this morning.
Plenty to talk about!
A great job by @RickieFowlerPGA in winning The Players yesterday.
Finally, your jealous critics can go to hell!
Good luck at The U.S. Open.
Denzel Washington gave a wonderful commencement speech over the weekend.
From the heart!
@foxandfriends in 5 minutes.
Great shot by @KingJames yesterday.
Lebron is a tough competitor who delivers under pressure.
Can you imagine, we spend billions of dollars protecting Saudi Arabia and now the King refuses to even meet with Obama.
Great leadership!
People are so jealous of Tom Brady and the Patriots.
No court could convict based on the evidence.
They can't beat him on the field, so this!
Why do we always try to destroy our true champions and winners in this country, while at the same time leaving the losers alone?
STUPID!
One of the dumber and least respected of the political pundits is Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post @TheFix.
What a STUPID deal for Verizon to buy AOL for $4.4 billion.
AOL has been bad luck for everyone who touched it.
Worth less than $1 billion!
Sue them Tom!
I was proud to be one of Ronald Reagan's earliest supporters.
Like Reagan, it's time to Make America Great Again!
Entrepreneurs: Be passionate.
You have to love what you're doing to be successful at it.
Entrepreneurs: Keep the big picture in mind.
There are always opportunites and possibilities & thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
Entrepreneurs: Look at the solution, not the problem.
Learn to focus on what will give results.
Glad the Trans-Pacific Partnership failed in the Senate.
Bad deal for American worker & economy!
We need SMART TRADE!
My @bostonherald interview on Tom Brady, Hillary Clinton, the Granite State & Making America Great Again!
Jeb Bush really blew his interview with @megynkelly - should cost him big time.
Amtrak crash near Philadelphia, train derails -many hurt, some badly.
Our country has horrible infrastructure problems.
Pols can't solve!
The only one to fix the infrastructure of our country is me - roads, airports, bridges.
I know how to build, pols only know how to talk!
Remember, politicians are all talk and NO action.
Our country is a laughing stock that is going to hell.
The lobbyists & donors control all!
TRAIN WRECK just the beginning.
Our roads, airports, tunnels, bridges, electric grid - all falling apart.
I am the BEST builder, just look at what I've built.
Hillary can't build.
Republican candidates can't build.
They don't have a clue!
We are rebuilding other countries while our own country is going to HELL.
Time to rebuild the U.S.A.!
My major hotel conversion of The Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. is under budget and ahead of schedule.

Only one knows The Art of The Deal.

You can be an @nfl player with murder charges and not be suspended.
Yet with NO EVIDENCE, @nfl targeted Tom Brady.
B.S.!
I hope Tom Brady sues the hell out of the @nfl for incompetence & defamation.
They will drop the case against him--and he will win.
Who ever heard of a legal conviction statement “more probable than not” against Tom Brady?
Sue them, Tom, and make lots of $.
I call Jeb Bush the reluctant warrior --- he just doesn't want to be doing this, he is not having fun!
Going to New Hampshire, all sold out crowds.
People want real change - POLS WILL NEVER MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN!
I cannot believe how bad Jeb Bush looks with his insane answer on Iraq, and then his numerous corrections which made him look even worse..
@BillRancic  Bill, fantastic job this morning on @foxandfriends - you are a total winner and I am proud of you as first Apprentice CHAMP!
Excited to keynote of the sold-out Pottawattamie County Republican Party Lincoln/Reagan Dinner tonight!
Looking forward to being interviewed by Sam Clovis tomorrow at @MorningsideEdu in Sioux City at 10AM CT!
Let’s Make America Great Again!
Excited to be speaking at @frankgaffney’s @securefreedom Iowa National Security Action Summit tomorrow at 1:30PM!
I am in Iowa today, great STATE, fantastic PEOPLE!
Many speeches, big crowds - all sold out!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Received a standing ovation in packed house @MorningsideEdu after Sam Clovis intro!
Let's Make America Great Again!
Today is armed forces day.
Thank you  to our military service members!
I love you all!
Jeb Bush gave five different answers in four days on whether or not we should have invaded Iraq.
He is so confused.
Not presidential material!
Marco Rubio was a complete disaster today in an interview with Chris Wallace @FoxNews concerning our invading Iraq.
I laugh when I see Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush pretending to "love" each other, with each talking of their great friendship.
Wow, ISIS has just taken the City of Ramadi in Iraq.
So many of our great soldiers died in originally going after it.
Such a waste.
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. So much to talk about but not much good news for the U.S.A. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Marco Rubio had no idea what he was doing on Chris Wallace show.
Said Iraq "was not a mistake".
He looked clueless!
Gallup finds Des Moines, Iowa, has the highest community pride (76.5) of any large city.
Congrats and I agree--I love the place!
@TrumpNationalNY- a great place!
Congrats to @greggutfeld on his new @FoxNews show!
Greg makes great TV and is a terrific guy.
Remember when Jeb gave Hillary a medal on the 1 year anniversary of Benghazi?!
FLASHBACK via @Reuters from 2004: “Donald Trump Would 'Fire' Bush Over Iraq Invasion” It's called great vision.
Our debt finances China’s military.
It's time to get tough – we hold all the cards.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
TPP does not stop Japan’s currency manipulation & China has a backdoor to join.
It must be stopped.
We need to protect the American worker!
Entrepreneurs:  Be tough, be smart, be personable --  but don't take things personally.
That's good business.

Incredible progress at @trumptowerpde – Punta del  Este, Uruguay -- the views are going to be fantastic!
With Sen.
Elizabeth Dole & @DoleFoundation Caregiver Fellows.
Tremendous people caring for our military & veterans!
A MUST WATCH - TRULY BEAUTIFUL!
WOW, SO NICE AND SO TRUE.
THANK YOU!
There is no way my friend Bob Kraft agreed not to appeal the NFL decision without making a deal to at least get something.
I now see John Kasich from Ohio- who is desperate to run- is using my line “Make America Great Again”.
Typical pol- no imagination!
What people don’t know about Kasich- he was a managing partner of the horrendous Lehman Brothers when it totally destroyed the economy!

Looking forward to receiving 2015 Statesman of the Year award tonight by @SRQRepublicans.
Just received huge applause when I said Berghdal should be sent back to Afghanistan!
@SRQRepublicans speech is sold out with record crowd.
Audience chanting "RUN TRUMP RUN"!

They are going to be very happy...
Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point: Grand Opening next Tuesday May 26th at 11 AM.
Jack Nicklaus will be joining me.
On this Memorial Day holiday, we honor our fallen soldiers who have made the greatest sacrifice for freedom.
They are our country’s finest.
A strong America creates opportunity and growth.
We just need to change Washington.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
I told @megynkelly that @oreillyfactor and I had identical views on a certain issue and she cut it out of the taped interview.
Why?
Too bad!
Think BIG!
You are going to be thinking anyway, so you might as well  think BIG!
Nobody understands politicians like I do - all talk and no action.
They will never get our country where it needs to be, truly great again!
I would like to wish everyone, including all haters and losers (of which, sadly, there are many) a truly happy and enjoyable Memorial Day!
The middle-class has become the new poor in this country and our incompetent politicians are unable to do anything about it.
They don't care!
I will be going to Trump Links at Ferry Point for the official opening of this long delayed  (but future NYC treasure) course.
My honor.
Whether you think you can or think you can't---you are right.
If any candidate believes that with what we know today we still should have invaded Iraq then they are unqualified to be Commander-in-Chief.
Entrepreneurs: See yourself as victorious--look at the solution, not the problem.
Entrepreneurs: Problems are a mind exercise.
Enjoy the challenge.
Entrepreneurs: Realize that persistence can go a long way.
Being stubborn is often an attribute..
@AnnCoulter's new book-- "Adios, America!
The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole"-- is a great read.
Good job!
Will be doing @greta interview  tomorrow.
So much to talk about!
A quote from the late, great golfer, Sam Snead: "Practice puts brains in your muscles"!
THIS IS TRUE ALSO IN LIFE.
Resolve never to quit, never to give up, no matter what the situation.
In business, you make decisions that are in your best interests.
Time for the US gov't to do the same.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
Good advice from my father: "Know everything you can about what you're doing".
Good advice from my mother:  "Trust in God and be true to yourself".
Politicians are all talk and no action.
Bush and Rubio couldn't answer simple question on Iraq.
They will NEVER make America great again!
In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake, but by what you finally accomplish!
My @greta int.
on @FoxNews on how to defeat ISIS, Obama losing ground to ISIS, & Making America Great Again!
Common Core is a federal takeover of school curriculum.
Department of Education should be disbanded not expanded.

It’s time for politicians to be reminded they work for us!
We can get it done.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
I had a fantastic time with @jacknicklaus at the grand opening of the great @TrumpFerryPoint.

Wow, the economy is really bad!

Only I can fix.
Jon Stewart is the most overrated joke on television.
A wiseguy with no talent.
Not smart, but convinces dopes he is!
Fading out fast.
While Jon Stewart is a joke, not very bright and totally overrated, some losers and haters will miss him and his dumb clown humor.
Too bad!
All the haters and losers must admit that, unlike others,  I never attacked dopey Jon Stewart for his phony last name.
Would never do that!
I would like to offer Vice President Biden my warmest condolences on the loss of his wonderful son, Beau.
Met him once, great guy!
For those of you that have conveniently fotgotten, dummy Jon Stewart is a bad filmmaker.
His last effort was a real bomb (in all ways)!
I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M.  ENJOY!

The Trans-Pacific Partnership will increase our trade deficits & send even more jobs overseas.
This is a bad deal.
Time for smart trade!
Looking forward to visiting Mason City, Iowa, tomorrow.
Will be my 8th day in the Hawkeye State this year!
Bureaucratic red tape and overregulation are discouraging the American dream.
It’s time for a bold new direction!
Excited to be returning to the @NCGOP State Convention as the Keynote of Saturday’s dinner!
@NCGOP is a strong Conservative state party!
Just as I predicted, while Obama lifted sanctions 18 months ago, Iran cheated & increased its nuclear fuel by 20%.
We must DOUBLE sanctions!

Trump Nat'l Golf Club, Philadelphia, is a 360 acre beauty and an award winning Tom Fazio designed course--fantastic!
Standing room only in Mason City, Iowa!
Thanks to the record crowd of over 400 supporters!
Standing ovation after promising to bring the American Dream back, and better than ever before!
With great patriots in Mason City who also want to bring the American Dream back!
We can Make America Great Again!
One of the worst and most boring political pundits on television is @krauthammer..
@krauthammer pretends to be a smart guy, but if you look at his record, he isn't.
A dummy who is on too many Fox shows.
An overrated clown!
Dummy political pundit @krauthammer constantly pressed the crazy war in Iraq.
Many lives and trillions of dollars wasted.
U.S. got NOTHING!
Was in Iowa yesterday-great people.
Record crowds at both speeches.
Something big is happening.
Pols are all talk.
Make America great again!
Trump International Golf Club Turnberry, Scotland -- home to four of the greatest Open Championships of all time...

China just hacked our federal government & stole gov.

Why do our leaders let China get away with this?!
No respect.
We must stop Common Core from controlling state & local curriculums.
It is a federal grab of education.
Keep education local!
Our nation has a duty to care for our vets & their families.
It's time to do it!
Let’s Make America Great Again!

Tomorrow will be a really big day for America.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thanks.
Great!
Will do, thanks.
Thanks.
Great!
Do we really need another Bush in the White House--- we have had enough of them.
Big time in U.S. today - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Politicians are all talk and no action - they can never bring us back.
Thanks.
It is almost time.
I will be making a major announcement from @TrumpTowerNY at 11AM.
Follow on social media!
In one hour I will be making a major announcement from Trump Tower.
Watch it live on Periscope!
Make sure to follow me on @periscopeco.
I will be streaming my announcement at 11AM.
Thanks Geraldo, you're a champion.
I am officially running for President of the United States.
Thanks Eric.
Today I officially declared my candidacy for President of the United States.
Dear @kimguilfoyle, Thank you so much for your nice words today on @TheFive.
Will not be forgotten!
In Iowa now.
Packed house!
Thanks @greggutfeld.
Really nice!
I’m glad I did your show.
Enjoyed watching @MonicaCrowley's analysis of my @BillOreilly interview.
Great points!
Thank you, Monica.
Only a fool would buy the @NYDailyNews.
Loses fortune & has zero gravitas.
Let it die!
We need someone with experience to rebuild America.
Heading to New Hampshire.
Speaking to great patriots @MCC_CT.
My first visit to Granite State since declaring my candidacy!
Thank you.
The tragedy in South Carolina is incomprehensible.
My deepest condolences to all.
Watch my appearance on @Morning_Joe - great interview!
Trump Nat'l Golf Club Philadelphia, 360 beautiful acres as designed by Tom Fazio with views of the Philly skyline.
Just watched Brian Williams on @TODAYshow - very sad!
Brian should get on with a new life and not start all over at @msnbc.
Goofy political pundit George Will spoke at Mar-a-Lago years ago.
I didn’t attend because he’s boring & often wrong—a total dope!
George Will was a big Iraq fool.
$2 trillion, thousands of lives lost -- & we got nothing!
Dummy.
Has Charles @krauthammer ever apologized for being so totally wrong on Iraq?
I called it right in every way—Make America Great Again!
Hillary Clinton reaches new low.
Stop saying I went bankrupt.
I never went bankrupt but like many great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage—smart!
People buy deals & immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals.
It’s a very effective & commonly used business tool.
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool.
Icahn, Black, Zell—but nobody says they went bankrupt!
Out of hundreds of deals & transactions, I have used the bankruptcy laws a few times to make deals better.
Nothing personal, just business.
Our country is in a major crisis of incompetent leadership.
We cannot continue to go on with these politicians who do nothing but talk.
Why did @DanaPerino beg me for a tweet (endorsement) when her book was launched?
Mexico is killing the United States economically because their leaders and negotiators are FAR smarter than ours.
But nobody beats Trump!
Druggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers are coming across the southern border.
When will the U.S. get smart and stop this travesty?
Thank you @AnnCoulter for your nice words.
The U.S. is becoming a dumping ground for the world.
Pols don't get it.
Make America Great Again!
Who would you rather have negotiating for the U.S. against Putin, Iran, China, etc.
, Donald Trump or Hillary?
Is there even a little doubt?
Happy Father's Day to all!
I had a wonderful and loving father..
@KarlRove, who spent $430 million in the last cycle and didn't win one race, said I'm not a candidate until I file papers.
Next week Karl!
@MarthaRaddatz was so unprofessional and biased when discussing me on This Week.
@GStephanopoulos should not allow this conduct!
The great Mike Wallace covered me in a much more professional manner than his son, Chris Wallace of @FoxNews.
Mike was a total pro!
@KarlRove stated clearly that he wants to repeal the 2nd Amendment.
I thought @FoxNews was going to fire that jerk after his Romney fiasco?
@KarlRove still thinks Romney won!
He doesn't have a clue!
Sadly, I will no longer be doing @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. on Mondays.
This is because I am running for president and law prohibits.
LOVE!
I want to thank Elizabeth, Steve, Brian and all of the great folks of @foxandfriends for the long and successful run we had together.
NICE!
@deneenborelli  Thank you for your nice words--greatly appreciated.
Thank you..
@JordanSpieth  Great job--you are a true champion!
See you soon.
It's time for government to stop picking winners & losers.
Let’s make sure everyone can achieve the American dream!
Who do you want negotiating for us?
The Senate must NOT pass TPA!
Any Senator who votes for it is disqualified for being POTUS.

@DanaPerino  Have you released a copy of the beautiful thank you card you sent me?
Would you like to see it?
True.
Today I filed my Statement of Candidacy with the FEC.
The highly respected Suffolk University poll just announced that I am alone in 2nd place in New Hampshire, with Jeb Bust (Bush) in first.
Politician @SenatorCardin didn't like that I said Baltimore needs jobs & spirit.
It's politicians like Cardin that have destroyed Baltimore.
Thank you..
@Neilyoung A few months ago Neil Young came to my office looking for $$ on an audio deal & called me last week to go to his concert.
Wow!
For the nonbeliever, here is a photo of @Neilyoung in my office and his $$ request—total hypocrite..
@Neilyoung’s song, “Rockin’ In The Free World” was just one of 10 songs used as background music.
Didn’t love it anyway.
Just out, the new nationwide @FoxNews poll has me alone in 2nd place, closely behind Jeb Bush-but Bush will NEVER Make America Great Again!
I am really beginning to respect Mark Halperin and John Heilemann as political reporters - they truly get why "Trump" poll numbers are high.
The ratings for The View are really low.
Nicole Wallace and Molly Sims are a disaster.
Get new cast or just put it to  sleep..
@WhoopiGoldberg had better surround herself with better hosts than Nicole Wallace, who doesn't have a clue.
The show is close to death!
My daughter Ivanka did great tonight in New Hampshire.
The sold out crowd loved her, and she loved them.
Thanks Ivanka!
My message, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, is beginning to take hold.
Bring back our jobs, strengthen our military and borders, help our VETS!
We have to bring back and cherish the middle class - once the backbone and true strength of the U.S.A.
It can happen!
I hear that dopey political pundit, Lawrence O'Donnell, one of the dumber people on television, is about to lose his show-no ratings?
Governor Rick Scott of Florida did really poorly on television this morning.
Mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation & horrible trade deals.
Forcing Univision to get me to stop- no way!
Univision wants to back out of signed @MissUniverse contract because I exposed the terrible trade deals that the U.S. makes with Mexico.
I love Mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the US so stupidly makes with them.
Really bad for US jobs, only good for Mexico.
Once again the Bush appointed  Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down.
Jeb pushed him hard!
Remember!
Anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision..
@Univision cares far more about Mexico than it does about the U.S.  Are they controlled by the Mexican government?
If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.
When somebody challenges you unfairly, fight back - be brutal, be tough - don't take it.
It is always important to WIN!
When you are in a war, or even a battle, losing is not an option!
@billmaher: Bill, you are really beginning to understand what is going on with "Trump" - actually, you always knew!
Only very stupid people think that the United States is making good trade deals with Mexico.
Mexico is killing us at the border and at trade!
The leader and negotiators representing Mexico are far smarter and more cunning than the leader and negotiators representing the U.S.!
I'll be in Iowa tonight making a speech to a record setting crowd.
The word is getting out, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
A great article by @NolteNC spelling out the truth on Mexico, trade, the border & illegals.
Addressing record crowd @ Madison County Iowa GOP Dinner.
We can bring common sense to DC & Make America Great Again!
Will be in Chicago tomorrow for a record setting (by far) luncheon.
See story in Fusion and Huff.
Post about rape at the border.
Beyond terrible!
Isn't Fusion owned by Univision?
@NYDailyNews, the dying tabloid owned by dopey clown Mort Zuckerman, puts me on the cover daily because I sell.
My honor, but it is dead!
Univision apologized to me but I will not accept their apology.
I will be suing them for a lot of money.
Miss U.S.A. contestants are hurt!
@jorgeramosnews Please send me your new number, your old one’s not working.
Saudi Arabia should be paying the United States many billions of dollars for our defense of them.
Without us, gone!
Remember, Univision apologized!
Speaking at the City Club of Chicago.
Sold out in minutes with thousands on the wait list!
We MUST have strong borders and stop illegal immigration.
Without that we do not have a country.
Also, Mexico is killing U.S. on trade.
WIN!
I love the Mexican people, but Mexico is not our friend.
They're killing us at the border and they're killing us on jobs and trade.
FIGHT!
Thank you Ted.
Watch me on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8PM.
My just filed lawsuit against Univision.
Always fight back when right.
Get ready for @Oreillyfactor tonight at 8- always interesting!
My recent statement re: @macys -- We must have strong borders & stop illegal immigration now!
Those who believe in tight border security, stopping illegal immigration &  SMART trade deals w/other countries should boycott @Macys..
@andersoncooper  Anderson—Thank you for being so fair with your reporting & story last night.
Greatly appreciated!
@GovernorPataki was a terrible governor of NY, one of the worst -- would’ve been swamped if he ran again!
@GovernorPataki  couldn’t be elected dog catcher if he ran again—so he didn’t!
Interesting that @Macys criticized me but just paid $650,000 in fines for racial profiling.
Are they racists?
Who is @Macys to pretend innocence when they “racial profile” all over the place?
Paid big fine!
Look what the President of NBC sent me recently about his stay in my Las Vegas hotel.
Very loyal guy.
Make our borders strong and stop illegal immigration..
@Macys stock just dropped.
Interesting.
So many people calling to say they are cutting up their @Macys credit card.
Thank you!
Why doesn’t somebody study the horrible charges brought against @Macys for racial profiling?
Terrible hypocrites!
A country must enforce its borders.
Respect for the rule of law is at our country’s core.
We must build a wall!
Obama once again just missed a self-imposed deadline with Iran.
Our leadership is weak & ineffective.
Double the sanctions!
It is time to bring competence to Washington.
It is time get results.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
As Governor of Texas, Rick Perry could have done far more to secure the border - but that's O.K., I like him anyway!
Mexican leaders and negotiators are much tougher and smarter than those of the U.S. Mexico is killing us on jobs and trade.
WAKE UP!
Wow, Huffington Post just stated that I am number 1 in the polls of Republican candidates.
Thank you, but the work has just begun!
We need jobs & we need them fast.
I am a job creator.
None of the pols can or will.
Let's Make America Great Again!
Our Southern border is totally out of control.
This is an absolutely disgraceful.
situation.
Our Southern border is unsecure.
I am the only one that can fix it, nobody else has the guts to even talk about it.
My heartfelt condolences to the family of Kathryn Steinle.
Very, very sad!
@marcorubio what do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we can't secure our border?
@TheJuanWilliams you never speak well of me & yet when I saw you at Fox you ran over like a child and wanted a picture.
Please share pic!
I will be on @foxandfriends this morning at 8:30.
Enjoy!
HAPPY 4TH OF JULY TO EVERYONE!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
What about the undocumented immigrant with a record who killed the beautiful young women (in front of her father) in San Fran.
Get smart!
Why would Republican candidates want the support of Mitt Romney.
He lost an election against Obama that should NEVER have been lost!
Rick Perry failed at the border.
Now he is critical of me.
He needs a new pair of glasses to see the crimes committed by illegal immigrants.
I appreciate the GOP candidates who remain strong on border security.
They know I am right.
A nation without borders cannot survive.
Jeb Bush will never secure our border or negotiate great trade deals for American workers.
Jeb doesn't see & can't solve the problems.
It is time to create jobs for Americans, not D.C.
We need a bold new direction.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
Thank you @loudobbsnews, I will be trying very hard to prove you right - great show!
We have got to take our country back.
It's time!
People rarely say that many conservatives didn’t vote for Mitt Romney.
If I can get them to vote for me, we win in a landslide..
@AnnCoulter U were great last nite @ericbolling on FOX.
Our country has become a dumping ground for the world--I'll get it to stop & fast!
Wow!
I hear that thousands of people are cutting up their @Macys credit card.
That's great.
We must restore the entrepreneurial spirit of our country.
A small business boom.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
I will be in California this weekend making a speech for Clint Eastwood.
Then to Arizona and Vegas.
Big crowds.
Discussing illegals & more!
@ronsirak Thank you for being so fair this morning on @GolfChannel—greatly appreciated..
@natalie_gulbis  Thank you for your support this morning on @GolfChannel.
Even more importantly, play well this week!
Say hi to all.
Dear @MaraLiasson, I greatly appreciate your fairness.
My history shows I never disappoint.
Looking forward to meeting you soon.
Do you believe that highly overrated political pundit  @krauthammer said this is the best Republican field in 35 years.
What a dope!
Jeb's brother George insisted on a $100,000 fee and $20,000 for a private jet to speak at a charity for severely wounded vets.
Not nice!
You mean George Bush sends our soldiers into combat, they are severely wounded, and then he wants $120,000 to make a boring speech to them?
Totally false reporting on my call with @Reince Priebus.
He called me, ten minutes, said I hit a “nerve", doing well, end!
Watched chief negotiator for Iran on @charlierose last night.
He is far smarter than our reps—increase sanctions and walk!
Dummy @Clare_OC from failing @Forbes magazine: NASCAR deal was 1 nite ballroom, ESPN was small golf outing...
Dummy @Clare_OC @Forbes: Tiny fragrance deal with Parlux means nothing.
Still sold at Trump Tower...
Why does a failed magazine like @Forbes constantly seek out trivial nonsense?
Their circulation way down.
Thanks.
True, thanks.
The elites want Common Core so they can take education out of parental control.
NO!
Let's Make America Great Again!
Obama and Republicans are hollowing out our military.
Now want to cut troop levels.
Lowest level in over 20 years.
I'm on @CNN's @AC360 tonight @8pm & @FoxNews' @seanhannity @ 10PM discussing immigration and lots of other things.
BREAKING - Border security rally in Phoenix, AZ at 2PM MST has been moved to @PhoenixConvCtr!
Build a wall!
Let's Make America Great Again!
Iran continues to delay the nuclear deal while doing many bad things behind our backs.
Time to WALK and double the sanctions.
Stop payments!
Jeb Bush just announced he raised over $100M.
Everyone of those people who contributed are getting something to the detriment of America!
Laura--Massive crowd, had to move to Phoenix Convention Center.
Our biggest problems are solved by growth.
We need a President who is a job creator.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
Standing with Jamiel Shaw, Sabine Durdin, Don Rosenberg, Lupe Moreno, Brenda Sparks, Robin Hvidston & their spouses.
Look forward to being in Phoenix tomorrow at 2:00 P.M. Hottest ticket in entire country.
Was supposed to be 500 people, now many thousands!
I love that thousands of people are boycotting @Macys and cutting up credit cards.
No guts no glory.
This really backfired - love it!
A strong military will stop wars.
Peace through Strength!
Let’s Make America Great Again!
The Republicans who want to cut SS & Medicaid are wrong.
A robust economy will Make America Great Again!
Has anyone seen the financials of @Univision.
They are doing really badly.
Too much debt and not enough viewers.
Need money fast.
Funny!
Boycott @Macys and @Univision.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Getting ready to go to Las Vegas (Freedom Fest) - great crowd.
Then on to amazing Phoenix - that will be a total happening!
Love America.
Today I will be rallying with with 15,000 patriots in Arizona for border security!
Let's Make America Great Again!
Today I am standing with patriots in Arizona for border security!
Build a wall!
Let's Make America Great Again!
Legal immigrants want border security.
It is common sense.
We must build a wall!
Let's Make America Great Again!
I will not be able to attend the Miss USA pageant tomorrow night because I am campaigning in Phoenix.
Wishing all well!
Convention Center officials in Phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room.
Phoenix Convention Center officials did not want to have thousands of people standing outside in the heat, so they let them in.
A GREAT day!
Mexico's biggest drug lord escapes from jail.
Unbelievable corruption and USA is paying the price.
I told you so!
Sleep eyes @ChuckTodd is killing Meet The Press.
Isn't he pathetic?
Love watching him fail!
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo', the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison?
rump, however, would kick his ass!
I hear that sleepy eyes @chucktodd will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press?
I can't imagine what is taking so long!
Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison, everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc.
coming into the U.S. comes over border!
but that's what I've been saying.
Very unfair treatment by the media!
The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no!
likewise, billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico    through the border.
We get the killers, drugs & crime, they get the money!
When will people, and the media, start to apologize to me for my statement, "Mexico is sending...
".
, which turned out to be true?
@McLaughlinGroup Greatly appreciate yr wonderful comments this weekend.
People of “great accomplishment” should easily quality for prez.
The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w/ my statements on border security.
Mexico’s totally corrupt gov’t looks horrible with El Chapo’s escape—totally corrupt.
U.S. paid them $3 billion.
El Chapo comes to the U.S. often thru our border—it's been revealed he has CA drivers license.
I absolutely support Kate’s Law—in honor of the beautiful Kate Steinle who was gunned down in SF by an illegal immigrant.
Let Pete Rose into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
It's time, he has paid a big and very long price!
Ford is MOVING jobs from Michigan to Mexico AGAIN!
Matt Harvey @Mets -- Don't let the @NYDailyNews get you down---nobody reads it.
Play well.
A nation without borders is no nation at all.
We must build a wall.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
I can't believe that President Obama isn't able or willing to make just one phone call to the family of Kate Steinle.
Come on Pres-MAKE CALL!
Who do you want negotiating for us?
Getting ready to land in Charlottesville, Virginia, at Trump Vineyards, another job producing development that I bought and made AMAZING!
We are no longer silent.
We are energized & ready to take our country back.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
@BradSteinle Thank you for yr wonderful tweet of July 4.
I wanted a little time to go by before calling.
Your sister & family are amazing.
Why do people listen to clown @KarlRove on @FoxNews?
Spent $430M & lost all races—a Bushy!
@FoxNews should not put @KarlRove on—he has no credibility, a bush plant who called all races wrong..
@StephenBaldwin7 You were fabulous on CNN last night--I greatly appreciate your support.
Best wishes.
Thank you Piers.
Irrelevant clown @KarlRove sweats and shakes nervously on @FoxNews as he talks "bull" about me.
Has zero cred.
Made fool of himself in '12.
I hear @pennjillette show on Broadway is terrible.
Not surprised, boring guy (Penn).
Without The Apprentice,  show would have died long ago.
I loved firing goofball atheist Penn @pennjillette on The Apprentice.
He never had a chance.
Wrote letter to me begging for forgiveness.
I hope the boycott of @Macys continues forever.
So many people are cutting up their cards..
@andydean2014 Thank you, you were great.
You can defend me anytime.
Amazing job..
@BradSteinle Great talking to you and your parents—fantastic people.
Keep your sister’s very important memory alive—big impact!
@FoxNews You shouldn’t have @KarlRove on the air—he’s a clown with zero credibility—a Bushy!
@KarlRove wasted $400 million + and didn’t win one race—a total loser.
Thank you.
They are great people!
Is this true about Univision and Fusion?
Wow!?!
No deal is better than a bad deal.
America out negotiated again.
Dopey @Lawrence O’Donnell, whose unwatchable show is dying in the ratings, said that my Apprentice $ numbers were wrong.
He is a fool!
The worst show in Las Vegas, in my opinion, is @pennjillette.
Hokey garbage.
New York show even worse!
The Iran deal poses a direct national security threat.
It must be stopped in Congress.
Stand up Republicans!
Leaving for New Hampshire now.
Making a speech—packed house.
Love it!
We need leaders who can negotiate great deals for Americans.
It is common sense.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
The thousands of people that showed up for me in Phoenix were amazing Americans.
@SenJohnMcCain called them "crazies"--must apologize!
@SenJohnMcCain should be defeated in the primaries.
Graduated last in his class at Annapolis--dummy!
@GovernorPerry just gave a pollster quote on me.
He doesn't understand what the word demagoguery means..
@GovernorPerry failed on the border.
He should be forced to take an IQ test before being allowed to enter the GOP debate.
Thoughts and prayers to the families of the four great Marines killed today.
Get rid of gun free zones.
The four great marines who were just shot never had a chance.
They were highly trained but helpless without guns.
I had thousands join me in New Hampshire last night!
@HillaryClinton had 68.
Looking forward to speaking at the @ARGOP Reagan-Rockefeller Dinner tonight!
Record crowd.
We are no longer silent!
MILITARY LIVES MATTER!
END GUN FREE ZONES!
OUR SOLDIERS MUST BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES!
THIS HAS TO STOP!
We will no longer be silent.
We can take our country back!
Let’s Make America Great Again!
@genesimmons really great job handling the wise guys --- so easy for you--- such talent!
I won’t forget..
@genesimmons,   Amazing!
Thank you.
The liberal clown  @ariannahuff told her minions at the money losing @HuffingtonPost to cover me as enterainment.
Made a speech in Arkansas last night before a record GOP crowd.
Great spirit and amazing people.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Ratings starved @CNN and @CNNPolitics does not cover me accurately.
Why can't they get it right - it's really not that hard!
The $10 billion (net worth) is AFTER all debt and liabilities.
So simple to understand but @CNN & @CNNPolitics is just plain dumb!
I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak.
People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant (Presbyterian).
GREAT.
Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, got a standing ovation from many wonderful people.
I will be back soon.
In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!
Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes!
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years .
John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything.
I will make this right for our great Vets!
It's a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans hat has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans.
Veterans deserve universal access to care.
VA scandal proves politicians are inept.
Congrats to the new Gov.
of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX, for taking a tough & bold stance at the border.
Should have been done long ago by Perry.
Why would anybody listen to @MittRomney?
He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama.
By the way,so did John McCain!
One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians.
I will fix VA quickly.
John McCain called thousands of people "crazies" when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix.
He owes apology!
The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly.
John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk.
The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter, and fast, or it will go down to a very big defeat - just like the last two times!
I will be making some very big campaign stops next week - big crowds and tremendous  energy!
The ever dwindling @WSJ which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for, is always hitting me politically.
Who cares!
We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.
It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn't do the Apprentice that they became upset w/ me.
This story is no longer about John McCain, it’s about our horribly treated vets.
Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans.
Look how small the pages have become @WSJ.
Looks like a tabloid—saving money I assume!
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00.
Will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans, illegal immigration, etc.
Wow, new @ABCnews/@WashingtonPost @GOP preference poll has DonaldTrump 11 points up!
Thank you.
Just got great national poll numbers - double digit lead!
Thank you, we will all MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Good luck to my new friends on your testimony in DC.
You are amazing people doing something so important--- stopping illegal immigration!
Rick Perry did an absolutely horrible job of securing the border.
He should be ashamed of himself.
Gov.
Abbott has since been terrific...
@ZachJohnsonPGA  You're one of the truly great competitiors.
I’ve said it for years.
Great going winning @OpenChampionship - Not surprised!
I'm glad President Obama followed my lead and lowered the flags half-staff.
It's about time!
Great day today in South Carolina.
Fantastic capacity crowd, amazing people!
I hear a failing New York newspaper is going to publish one of my old cell phone numbers.
So original - just one of many!
True, thanks..
@GovernorPerry in my office last cycle playing nice and begging for my support and money.
Hypocrite!
I'm going to the BORDER tomorrow.
Will be seeing some really brave people.
Look forward to a big day!
Thank you @chucktodd for your commentary last night on @NBCNightlyNews.
Very fair -- we are making progress together!
Obama still will keep all military recruitment centers & bases Gun Free Zones!
It has to stop.
MILITARY LIVES MATTER!
Will be interviewed by @andersoncooper on @CNN tonight.
Let’s see if he treats me fairly—enjoy!
Shouldn’t George Will have to give a disclaimer every time he is on Fox that his wife works for Scott Walker?
Let’s Trump the Establishment!
We are no longer silent.
We will Make America Great Again!
It's going to take an outsider to clean up after Clinton, Bush and Obama.
Let's Make America Great Again!
@FrankLuntz knows nothing about me or my religion.
Came to my office looking for work.
I had NO interest.
I will save the vets!
@tedcruz you were terrific on @seanhannity tonight.
I am going to the border tomorrow..
@AC360  Has the absolutely worst anti-Trump talking heads on his show.
Dopey writer O'brian knows nothing about me or my wealth.
A waste!
Boycott @Macys, no guts, no glory.
Besides, there are far better stores!
What a waste of time being interviewed by @andersoncooper when he puts on really stupid talking heads likeTim O'Brien-dumb guy with no clue!
@BillKristol   Bill, your small and slightly failing magazine will be a giant success when you finally back Trump.
Country will soar!
Getting ready to lift off for Laredo.
Will land at 1:OO P.M. Should be exciting and informative!
True!
Thanks.
Great!
@bobbyjindal watched you on @TeamCavuto.
Made some excellent points.
Best Wishes.
You’re just not getting there @DanaPerino.
Sometimes things just don’t work out, but don’t worry--- no problem!
Thoughts & prayers with everyone in Lafayette, Louisiana this evening.
True..
@williebosshog watched you on @foxandfriends.
You were great and I appreciate the nice statements.
I’m sending out for your new book now!
When will anyone be held accountable for the VA scandal?
The politicians are experts in never facing any consequence.
DC has shrunk our military and exploded our country with debt.
I love Bluffton, SC, what a great place -- what great people.
Arriving to check out the border.
From an amazing day on the border in Laredo.
Be sure to get a copy of @williebosshog's new book, American Hunter.
It is time to send someone from the outside to fix DC from the inside.
Let’s Make America Great Again!
True, thanks.
True!
@marklevinshow has written a great book, Plunder and Deceit.
He powerfully analyzes issues that are crucial to us today.
Read it!
Thank you @DennisRodman.
Isn’t it amazing that @Macys paid a massive fine for profiling African Americans--& then criticized me for discussing illegal immigration!
Getting ready to go to Iowa today.
Big crowd - will be a great day!
Big poll just out by @TheEconomist has me in 1st.
place by a lot.
A great honor but we have a long way to go to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The ultra liberal and seriously failing Des Moines Register is BEGGING my team for press credentials to my event in Iowa today-but they lie!
@Macy’s is a big contributor to @PPFA .
Anybody against Planned Parenthood should boycott racial profiling Macy’s..
@ShawnJohnson Congratulations on your engagement --- he is a lucky guy.
You are  a true winner and will be an amazing couple..
@ScottWalker despite your coming to my office to give me an award, your very dumb fundraiser hit me very hard--- not smart!
Supporters waiting to hear me speak in Oskaloosa, Iowa.
Great success in Iowa today.
Fantastic sold out crowd.
Will be back soon!
Always great to speak with Veterans - our nation's heroes.
We will Make America Great Again!
@ScottWalker is a nice guy, but not presidential material.
Wisconsin is in turmoil, borrowing to the hilt, and doing poorly in jobs etc.
Thank you, Greta.
When people find out how bad a job Scott Walker has done in WI, they won’t be voting for him.
Massive deficit, bad jobs forecast, a mess..
@SteveRattner While I think you should have gone to prison for what you did, I guess Obama saved you.
But watch – I will win!
Thanks.
We must build a wall to secure our border.
It will save lives and help Make America Great Again!
Veterans, please call 855- VETS- 352 or email address veterans@donaldtrump.com to share your stories about the need to reform the VA.
Thanks Lou..
@GovernorSununu who couldn't get elected dog catcher in NH forgot to mention my phenomenal biz success rate: 99.
I own Turnberry, in Scotland, one of great resorts in world.
Women’s British Open there this week.
I’ll go for two days & back on trail.
Be in Turnberry on Thurs AM for start of Women's British Open, one of  world's great golf tournaments.
I’ll be on @seanhannity tonight at 10 PM and look forward to it.
Lots to discuss!
Enjoy.
Boston's Mayor Walsh wasted a lot of time and money on going for the Olympics, and then he gave up.
I don't want him negotiating for me!
Will be interviewed tonight on @seanhannity at 10:00.
There is so much to talk about!
Thank you @scottienhughes for the great job you did on @CNN.
Great energy and smarts!
I will not let you down..
@TheBrodyFile was fantastic tonight on @CNN.
Thank you, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
After all is said and done, more is said than done.
Thank you @mcuban for your nice words.
I am rapidly becoming a @dallasmavs fan!
We must protect our veterans.
My @FoxNews int.
with @seanhannity on Obama being all talk & no action & making America Great Again!
Obama’s nuclear deal with the Iranians will lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.
It has to be stopped.
We can make Washington work for us.
It’s time for real leadership.
While I’m beating my opponents in the polls, I’m also beating lobbyists, special interests & donors that are supporting them with billions.
A nation WITHOUT BORDERS is not a nation at all.
We must have a wall.
The rule of law matters.
Jeb just doesn’t get it..
@CNN & @CNNPolitics did not say that lawyer Beck lost the case and I got legal fees.
Also, she wanted to breast pump in front of me at dep.
Lawyer Elizabeth Beck was easy for me to beat.
Ask her clients if they are happy with her results against me.
Got total win and legal fees..
CNN & @CNNPolitics  Lawyer Elizabeth Beck did a terrible job against me, she lost (I even got legal fees)..
@CNN  Why is somebody (Beck) I beat so soundly all of a sudden an expert on Donald Trump (all over television).
She knows nothing about me.
So many people who know nothing about me are commenting all over T.V. and the media as though they have great D.J.T. insight.
Know NOTHING!
Thank you @Morning_Joe for throwing the pathetic reporter from the failing and money losing Daily Beast off the air.
Really cool!
I truly LOVE all of the millions of people who are sticking with me despite so many media lies.
There is a great SILENT MAJORITY looming!
This is an outrage!
Bias-Free Language Guide claims the word 'American' is 'problematic' -- WHAT?!
Per @rushlimbaugh: Why does Hillary Clinton get the benefit of the doubt (after she DESTROYS her illegal email server)   while Tom Brady is guilty because he REPLACED his LEGAL cellphone?
Trump Will Make America GREAT!!!!
How can a dummy dope like Harry Hurt, who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me, be on TV discussing Trump?
People like lawyer Elizabeth Beck and failed writer Harry Hurt & others talk about me but know nothing about me—crazy!
Thank you.
I really like the Koch Brothers (members of my P.B. Club), but I don't want their money or anything else from them.
Cannot influence Trump!
Getting ready to leave for my GREAT resort, Turnberry, in Scotland.
Hosting The Women's British Open (biggest tournament).
Will be back Sat.
Carl Cameron @FoxNews is the only reporter I know who consistently fumbles & misrepresents poll results.
He has been so wrong & he hates it!
Just at a news conference from Trump Turnberry in Scotland.
Everybody was there & will be all over television tonite.
I look forward to the debate on Thursday night & it is certainly my intention to be very nice & highly respectful of the other candidates.
The polls have been consistently great.
The silent majority is speaking.
Politicians are failing.
Thank you.
Thank you for your service!
Should not raise taxes in Wisconsin, but massive budget deficit.
Education, roads, etc suffering.
@DanHenninger lies.
Will be leaving Trump Turnberry tomorrow--place & Women's British Open are great.
Will be back hitting hard tomorrow.
Wow, some new and even greater polls--thank you!
If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing, you're right.
I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc.
from the Koch Brothers.
Puppets?
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 7:00.
Enjoy!
Bush is pretending that the "Trump surge" is great for him and the @nytimesworld is  reporting Bush "delight" - con job, a Bush nightmare!
Despite the false @nytimes story about Jeb Bush being happy with the Trump surge, he fell more than anybody & is miserable..
@DottieandBogey Thanks for nice comments over weekend re Turnberry.
You and your husband have fantastic taste!
Also, great commentary..
@Jrprotalker Thanks Judy for the wonderful statements on @TrumpTurnberry.
Great seeing you there & you did a fabulous job on commentary.
It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails.
Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world.
New Poll Shows Donald Trump Blowing Everyone Else Out of the Water.
We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
Thank you @krauthammer for your nice comments on @oreillyfactor.
A lot of progress is being made!
Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:3O.
Enjoy!
Diligence is the mother of good luck.
Thank you @gawker!
Call me on my cellphone 917.756.8000 and listen to my campaign message.
I will be on @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 8 PM and 11 PM.
Many of Hillary’s donors are the same donors as Jeb Bush’s—all rich, will have total control—know them well.
Do you notice that Hillary spews out Jeb's name as often as possible in order to give him status?
She knows Trump is her worst nightmare.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Wow!
Such a wonderful article from fantastic people--my great honor!
@realbobmassi, who does a show called "Bob Massi Is The Property Man" on @FoxNews, really knows his stuff--a total pro!
I look forward to tonight's "debate" -- but look far more forward to making America great again.
It can happen!
Wow!
Thank you @TIME readers- a great honor!
Wow!
@FrankLuntz is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and I had zero interest.
Now he picks anti-Trump panels!
@FrankLuntz I won every poll of the debate tonight by massive margins @DRUDGE_REPORT & @TIME  so where did you find that dumb panel.
Wow, @megynkelly really bombed tonight.
People are going wild on twitter!
Funny to watch..
@FrankLuntz, your so-called "focus groups" are a total joke.
Don't come to my office looking for business again.
You are a clown!
I really enjoyed the debate tonight even though the @FoxNews trio, especially @megynkelly, was not very good or professional!
@FoxNews you should be ashamed of yourself.
I got you the highest debate ratings in your history & you say nothing but bad .
Dopey @krauthammer should be fired.
The hatred that clown @krauthammer has for me is unbelievable – causes him to lie when many others say Trump easily won debate.
So many "politically correct" fools in our country.
We have to all get back to work and stop wasting time and energy on nonsense!
Re Megyn Kelly quote: "you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever" (NOSE)..
@redstate I miss you all, and thanks for all of your support.
Political correctness is killing our country.
"weakness".
Wow, CNN just said that Donald Trump won the DEBATE, connected best with audience.
Also, Time, Drudge, Newsmax, N.Y.Times and more!
Almost universal support that "Trump won the debate".
Only @FoxNews is consistantly fighting the Trump win, and I got them the ratings!
Small crowds at @RedState today in Atlanta.
I just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache.
She has zero chance!
It amazes me that other  networks seem to treat me so much better than @FoxNews.
I brought them the biggest ratings in history, & I get zip!
Wonderful Frank Gifford has just passed away at age 84.
He was my friend and a truly great guy!
Warmest condolences to family.
I will be interviewed on @TODAY Show at 7:00 A.M. and on Morning Joe at 7:20..
@KathieLGifford, Melania  and I send our deepest condolences.
Frank was a special and amazing person.
He will be missed by all!
Oh really, check out innocent @megynkelly discussion on @HowardStern show 5 years ago--I am the innocent (pure) one!
Roger Ailes just called.
He is a great guy & assures me that “Trump” will be treated fairly on @FoxNews.
His word is always good!
Enough is Enough- no more Bushes!
Frank was a great guy married to an absolutely wonderful woman @KathieLGifford.
What a couple!
@OMAROSA You were fantastic on television this weekend.
Thank you so much – you are a loyal friend!
@BrandenRoderick I was pleased to see the wonderful statements you made about me to the media..
@KatrinaCampins Thank you so much for the wonderful statements you made about me on TV.
Also, keep up the great work!
Again, illegal immigrant is charged with the fatal  bludgeoning of a wonderful and loved 64 year old woman.
Get them out and build a WALL!
Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain.
He was terrible at DEBATE!
We must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration.
Rampant problems will only get worse.
Take back our country!
Why is @RandPaul allowed to take advantage of the people of Kentucky by running for Senator and Pres.
Why should Kentucky be back up plan?
@ericbolling you can do much better than you did tonight on @oreillyfactor.
Better luck tomorrow!
@SenTedCruz had a very good debate, far better than Rand Paul.
Our online store is officially open!
Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight for the full hour.
Hope you enjoy it and, more importantly, hope you agree!
Our online campaign store is officially open!
Our campaign store is officially open!
People don’t understand that I left The Apprentice to run for Pres—the Apprentice DID NOT leave me.
Bob Greenblatt & folks @NBC were GREAT!
@AP and @HuffingtonPost should change their fraudulent story to say THAT I DROPPED @NBC & The Apprentice to run for President!
Making speech tonight in New Hampshire - leaving now.
Fantastic people, fantastic crowd!
In the plane heading to Iowa State Fair.
Will be great fun.
Hopefully giving helicopter rides to some of the kids.
Just got back from the Iowa State Fair.
Record crowds, phenomenal people.
Thank you IOWA, I will never let you down!
@NicolleDWallace  Your father is a brilliant man with wonderful sense -- therefore, you must be good!
I really enjoyed being at the Iowa State Fair.
The crowds, love and enthusiasm is something I will never forget.
The polls have been really amazing--we are all tired of incompetent politicians and bad deals!
Why does @FoxNews keep George Will as a talking head?
Wrong on so many subjects!
Listening to @rushlimbaugh on way back to Jury Duty.
Fantastic show, terrific guy!
It does matter!
I want talented people to come into this country—to work hard and to become citizens.
Silicon Valley needs engineers, etc.
When foreigners attend our great colleges & want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country.
Our online campaign store is open!
@jasondhorowitz  I am very proud of my sister, your story was terrific.
Thank you so much.
If I am elected President I will immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline.
I am looking forward to being in New Hampshire tomorrow.
The silent majority is taking our country back.
We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@MarkSteynOnline - Thank you and great job on @seanhannity tonight!
Will be in New Hampshire and then on @CNN Special at 9 PM tonight.
Just got back from New Hampshire.
Amazing people, we all had a great time together!
Another great poll result!
Thank you!
Thank you New Hampshire!
Together we will Make America Great Again!
On the cover of @TIME Magazine—a great honor!
Had a special visitor in my office yesterday for @TIME photo shoot.
Behind the scenes video with “Uncle Sam” (eagle’s name) and me..
@TomLlamasABC cannot report the news truthfully.
Why not apologize for your fraudulent story on World News Tonight.
We are going to make our country so strong again, so great again.
No more ripping off the United States.
We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Alabama will shine tomorrow.
It will be a big and glorious day!
Jeb Bush signed memo saying not to use the term "anchor babies," offensive.
Now he wants to use it because I use it.
Stay true to yourself!
How crazy - 7.5% of all births in U.S. are to illegal immigrants, over 300,000 babies per year.
This must stop.
Unaffordable and not right!
We are going to have a wild time in Alabama tonight!
Finally, the silent majority is back!
Great!
Boston incident is terrible.
We need energy and passion, but we must treat each other with respect.
I would never condone violence.
Leaving for Mobile, Alabama, right now - can't be late!
Dow dives more than 500 points - down 9% from high.
Be careful!
@jessebwatters, You did a great job hosting @oreillyfactor.
Everybody loved it!
Thank you for the nice words.
Alabama was great last night, amazing people.
Nice!
@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source, and that is saying something.
They go out of their way to distort truth!
I had 15,000 people in Phoenix but @politico said "the rooms capacity is just over 2000".
But said Bernie  Sanders had 11,000 in same room.
Thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive  story on my speech in Alabama last night.
It was a great evening!
How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone?
Very sad!
Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border, most other candidates are finally  speaking up.
Just politicians!
Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration, in favor of common core, bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing.
Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body.
Jeb just can't get it right!
The last thing we need is another Bush in the White House.
Would be the same old thing (remember "read my lips, no more taxes").
GREATNESS!
New Reuters Poll just came out and has me at 32%, highest number yet.
The silent majority is back and we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
As I have long stated, we are so tied in with China and Asia that their markets are now taking the U.S. market down.
Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda.
This could get very messy!
Vote Trump.
Depression- be careful of China!
Thank you Greta..
@megynkelly must have had a terrible vacation, she is really off her game.
Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West.
No clue on immigration!
I liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly.
Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation!
Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising, signage, materials etc.
Is he ashamed of the name BUSH?
A pretty sad situation.
Go Jeb!
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics.
A mess!
Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a "fence".
It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!
@GovernorPataki did a terrible job as Governor of New York.
If he ran again, he would have lost in a landslide.
Congrats @LindseyGrahamSC.
You just got 4 points in your home state of SC—far better than zero nationally.
You’re only 26 pts behind me.
Another good poll result in the great state of SC.
Trump at 30%.
Carson at 15% and Bush at 9%.
Thanks.
True, thanks.
Great American heroes who averted an attack in France.
THANK YOU!
Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, & Alex Skarlatos.
Thank you @BillKristol.
I am going to Make America Great Again!
Heading to Iowa to a packed house.
Just released polls, all first place, are amazing.
Thank you!
Just got back from Iowa.
Fantastic evening with truly fabulous people.
Will be back again soon.
Thanks!
Will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow this morning at 7:00.
Talking about politics, polls and whatever.
Enjoy!
@DennisDMZ Thanks for the nice words.
You are fantastic!
@KatrinaCampins You were absolutely great on @CNN!
Thank you.
Great job on @CNN tonight @heytana.
We are all proud of you!
Also, congrats on a great son - he is going places.
The press has very inaccurately covered this event - see for yourself!
@BenFergusonShow just watched you on @CNN.
Thank you for your nice comments.
Who wants the endorsement of a guy (@EricCantor) who lost in perhaps the greatest upset in the history of Congress?
Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:00 A.M. So much to talk about!
Great job tonight on @FoxNews Tony.
I am with you all the way!
A phony story that I am trying to buy a soccer team in Argentina is untrue.
Never even heard of the team—no interest!
Will be interviewed by @SarahPalinUSA tonight at 10:00 on OAN Network.
Enjoy!
Great rally last night in Massachusetts.
Unbelievable spirit to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
Leaving now for Tennessee.
Big crowd!
Wow, Jeb Bush just lost three of his top fundraisers - they quit!
Loved being with my many friends in Tennessee.
The crowd and enthusiasm was fantastic.
I won the straw poll big!
Leading in the Bloomberg Iowa poll.
Also, my favorability numbers went up at a record, almost unheard of, clip.
Thank you Iowa!
For those that don’t think a wall (fence) works, why don’t they suggest taking down the fence around the White House?
Foolish people!
Very proud of Trump Int'l Golf Links in Aberdeen, Scotland.
President Obama wants to change the name of Mt.
McKinley to Denali after more than 100 years.
Great insult to Ohio.
I will change back!
More sensitive when she was Sec.
of State.
This is a very big deal.
Just out - new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%.
I wonder why only @FoxNews has not reported this?
Too bad!
The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP - national result) is the best yet.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign.
Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?
Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists & special interests.
Bad system.
While millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates.
I am self funding.
Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast!
No more Clintons or Bushes!
Many Super Pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to “attack” Trump.
I’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so, but hope it is appreciated by the voters.
Why does @oreillyfactor and @FoxNews always have Karl Rove on.
He spent $430 million and lost ALL races.
Every Poll has me winning BIG.
If you listen to dopey Karl Rove, a Trump hater, on @oreillyfactor, you would think I'm doing poorly.
The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1,000,000 contribution.
I said no way!
When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.
Will be interviewed on @GMA this morning at 7:00.
Thanks for the GREAT poll results!
A terrible deal with Iran!
@kevinolearytv Great job on @foxandfriends this morning.
You tell it like it is!
Also, thx for the nice mention.
Your book sounds great!
@brithume, I am in first place by a lot in all polls, tied for first place with Ben Carson in one Iowa poll.
The deal with Iran will go down as one of the most incompetent ever made.
The U.S. lost on virtually every point.
We just don't win anymore!
Congratulations to Tom Brady on yet another great victory- Tom is my friend and a total winner!
Will be on @Morning_Joe in 5 minutes - at 7:00.
Enjoy!
I’ll be in Dallas at the American Airlines Center on Sept 14th at 6 PM.
Will be great to be back in Texas.
So nice, thank you Laura.
Terrific response to my previous tweet: "I’ll be in Dallas at the American Airlines Center on Sept 14th at 6 PM"..
@MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday.
Angry and obnoxious, she will never make it on T.V. @FoxNews can do so much better!
The Dallas event in two weeks, at the American Airlines Center, is filling up fast.
Get your tickets fast,  before it is too late!
Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN.
He is just a 3rd rate "gotcha" guy!
Just announced that because of "Trump", advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200,000, a 4000% increase.
PAY CHARITY?
Saudi Arabia was "vehemently" against the Iran nuclear deal.
Then today they embraced it.
What happened?
What did we give them to endorse?
Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen.
Hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...
but there was no emotion, no truth.
Just can't read speeches!
Remember that I am self-funding my campaign.
Hillary, Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.
By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists.
I am only working for the people of the U.S.!
The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP.
They are paying practically nothing.
We must reduce taxes for the middle class!
The phony Club For Growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (I said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me.
Total hypocrites!
Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision, not someone like Hillary or Barack, neither of which has a clue!
The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M. at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success.
Tickets are going FAST!
I will be in Washington D.C. on Wednesday,1 P.M.,in front of the Capitol, to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran..
@club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1,000,000.
When I said no, they came out against me.
A scam operation?
Thank you @scottienhughes for your powerful words on @FoxNews.
I am with the Evangelicals and Tea Party big time.
We will all WIN  together!
Remember, I'll see you in D.C. at the Capitol Building on Wednesday at 1:00 o'clock.
Then Dallas on Sept.
Both Washington D.C. and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events.
D.C. is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech!
Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D.C. on Wednesday (1:00 P.M. at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal!
Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran.
Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol.
Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran.
Wow!
Such nice words from Robert Redford on my running for President.
Thank you, Robert.
Thank you @IngrahamAngle for your strength & wonderful words last night on @FoxNews, but @KarlRove is easy to beat!
Wake up Jeb supporters!
I’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists & special interests for Jeb & others are starting to do big ads—desperate!
Don’t believe them.
The lobbyists & special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me "just a little" but is very false!
Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse.
Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow!
I'm on Bill @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM.
A great honor to receive polling numbers like these.
Record setting African American (25%) & Hispanic numbers (31%).
Will be on Bill O'Reilly @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM.
Enjoy!
See you in D.C. tomorrow at 1:00 P.M. at the Capitol to protest the horribly negotiated deal with Iran.
Really sad!
Man did JEB throw his brother under the bus last night on @colbertlateshow .
Probably true, but not nice!
I had a great day in D.C. even though the subject was an unpleasant one, the horrible Iran Nuke deal.
Amazing crowd and enthusiasm!
Bobby Jindal did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him….....
I only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls.
I never thought he had a chance and I’ve been proven right.
I will be on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon tonight at 11:30.
Should be fun!
Also, tomorrow night I will be going to Boone and Ames.
Really look forward to seeing all of my friends in Iowa.
Oh wow, lightweight Governor @BobbyJindal, who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair.
So original!
Let’s all take a moment to remember all of the heroes from a very tragic day that we cannot let happen again!
Just purchased NBC’s half of The Miss Universe Organization and settled all lawsuits against them.
Now own 100% -- stay tuned!
@robertjeffress I greatly appreciate your kind words last night on @FoxNews.
Have great love for the evangelicals -- great respect for you.
On @FallonTonight with @jimmyfallon at 11:30 PM.
Enjoy!
@GovernorPerry is a terrific guy and I wish him well- I know he will have a great future!
Amazing crowd outside @FallonTonight.
Tune in tonight at 11:30.
The Tonight Show @nbc will be amazing - 11:30 P.M.  ENJOY!
Backstage with @jimmyfallon before opening skit- great fun!
Will be on @foxandfriends at 8:00.
Enjoy!
@mercedesschlapp thank you so much for your kind words on television -- fantastic job and greatly appreciated!
Trump’s Campaign Hat Becomes an Ironic Summer Accessory - The New York Times.
Donald Trump Sends @FallonTonight to Highest Friday Rating in 18 Months.
Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him.
I truly understood the appeal of Ron Paul, but his son, @RandPaul, didn't get the right gene.
Too many people on stage for debate.
@RandPaul at 11th, with 2% in @RealClearNews, shouldn't be allowed to participate.
I am having a great time in Iowa at Jack Trice Stadium!
Unbelievable people.
Had a record crowd in Boone, Iowa.
Why is someone like George Pataki, who did a terrible job as Governor of N.Y. and registers ZERO in the polls, allowed on the debate stage?
My honor, thank you.
Congrats to my friend @Schwarzenegger who is doing next season’s  Celebrity Apprentice.
He'll be great & will raise lots of $ for charity.
To all my fans, sorry I couldn’t do The Apprentice any longer—but equal time (presidential run) prohibits me from doing so.
Love!
Thanks Mark, will be fun.
My opponents big bosses--lobbyists and donors--are trying to do damage.
They will fail!
Money down the drain!
Looking forward to joining @V4SA Tuesday 9/15 in L.A. aboard the @USSIowa - The Battleship of Presidents!
Join us!
The event with me and @V4SA in L.A on 9/15 is turning out to be huge.
Vets mistreated, NO border security?
Unbelievable crowd in Dallas!
Speech in Dallas went really well.
Big and wonderful crowd.
Just arrived in L.A. Big day tomorrow!
I will rebuild the military, take care of vets and make the world respect the US again!
Join me today.
Loved Dallas and the tremendous crowd last night.
Will be back!
Our vets are treated like 3rd class citizens.
Enough!
Join me & @V4SA on @USSIOWA at LA Waterfront to hear my plan for vets & the military!
Am now in L.A. Will be going to the U.S.S. IOWA at 5:30 P.M. to speak to our great VETERANS and other friends!
Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1,000,000 - I said "NO".
Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads!
My plan will lower taxes for our country, not raise them.
Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxes—just another lie..
@club4growth asked me for $1 million.
I said no.
Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes.
I’ll lower big league for middle class.
Everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in Dallas last night.
Spectacular crowd & arena!
Thank you @mcuban..
@rushlimbaugh Rush, I am in LA inspecting property (big job creator) & listening to you.
You are truly fantastic--thanks!
Just finished the wonderful event on the U.S.S. Iowa.
VETERANS FOR A STRONG AMERICA endorsed me.
Such a great honor, thank you!
I hope Arnold S. does well with the Apprentice because he is a nice guy and also, because I get a big percentage of the profits!
Will be heading over to the debate soon.
Can you believe @CNN is "milking" it for almost 3 hours?
Too long, too many people on stage!
A great honor from somebody that knows how to win!
Thank you to Tom Brady, Coach Ditka, Coach Bobby Knight and all of the many champions that have been so supportive!
Just announced that in the history of @CNN, last night’s debate was its highest rated ever.
Will they send me flowers & a thank you note?
Every poll done on debate last night, from Drudge to Newsmax to Time Magazine, had me winning in a landslide.
Going to New Hampshire in a little while.
Big crowds!
Will be interviewed tonight by @seanhannity on @FoxNews at 10 PM.
Enjoy!
Would be really bad if columnist Mike Lupica left the @NYDailyNews.
A wonderful and talented guy!
GIVE AMERICA BACK ITS DREAM!
Thank you.
I’ve just released my position papers on The Second Amendment.
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him?
I don't think so!
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue?
No chance!
If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech.
A no win situation!
Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake!
On my way to Iowa.
Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours.
See ya!
A great night in Iowa!
Thank you Faith and Freedom Forum & @UrbandaleSchool.
I had a great time in Iowa today!
I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30.
@nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers.
Based on the debate results, I should do well-who knows?
There is no way that Carly  Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems.
Boxer killed her for Senate in California!
I have been leading big in all  polls, with two more today, @nbc and @CNN.
The NBC poll is more than double next,  at 29%.
Fiorina has 11%.
I am attracting the biggest crowds, by far, and the best poll numbers, also by far.
Much of the media is totally dishonest.
So sad!
We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe better than ever before!
Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP, virtually destroying both companies, that she never got another CEO job offer!
Pres.
Will be on @foxandfriends  now.
Enjoy!
The @TODAYshow refused to use their just in poll numbers where I have a massive lead but instead used @CNN numbers where my lead is smaller.
New Zogby poll— highly respected— but the media won’t report it because it gives me an even bigger lead!
Carly Fiorina is terrible at business--the last thing our country needs!
Has the media picked up the new Zogby poll that was just put out?
I doubt it!
I just wrapped up a Q&A @TwitterNYC.
Thanks for all your questions!
Thank you Dan--I agree!
Best wishes.
I got to know @ScottWalker well—he’s a very nice person and has a great future..
@oreillyfactor was very negative to me in refusing to to post the great polls that came out today including NBC.
@FoxNews not good for me!
@oreillyfactor, why don't you have some knowledgeable talking heads on your show for a change instead of the same old Trump haters.
Boring!
I am having a really hard time watching @FoxNews..
@RichLowry is truly one of the dumbest of the talking  heads - he doesn't have a clue!
TRUMP 32, CARSON 12, BUSH 11, FIORINA 6, RUBIO 5, CRUZ 5.
Yom Kippur blessings to all of my friends in Israel and around the world.
Senator Marco "amnesty" Rubio, who has worst voting record in Senate, just hit me on national security-but I said don't go into Iraq.
Do you ever notice that lightweight @megynkelly constantly goes after me but when I hit back it is totally  sexist.
She is highly overrated!
I think @megynkelly should take another eleven day "unscheduled" vacation.
Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008.
She was all in!
I will be the featured guest on the season opener of  @60Minutes this Sunday.
There certainly is plenty to talk about!
I will be doing @colbertlateshow at 11:30 on CBS.
Enjoy!
@JuliInkster  Congratulations on your great win--what a captain, what a champion!
Headline reads" Rubio passes Bush in Florida poll" -- Unfair, because Trump destroys them both!
Trump 31.5%, Rubio 19.2%, Bush 11.
Yogi Berra was not only a great baseball player, he was a great guy.
Yogi will be missed..
@FoxNews has been treating me very unfairly & I have therefore decided that I won't be doing any more Fox shows for the foreseeable future.
Wow!
What a great night.
Incompetent @RichLowry lost it tonight on @FoxNews.
He should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him!
@FoxNews owes me an apology for allowing clueless pundit @RichLowry to use such foul language on TV.
Unheard of!
So happy about my daughter @IvankaTrump’s announcement that she will be having a baby this spring.
Congratulations!
Despite the establishment and the media’s best efforts, the people are speaking loudly and clearly.
Thank you to my amazing supporters!
@politico, which is not read or respected by many, may be the most dishonest of the media outlets--- and that is saying something.
The failing @politico news outlet, which I hear is losing lots of money, is really dishonest!
Wow, a really nice lead in New Hampshire--- an increase since my last poll!
Just watched @marcorubio on television.
Just another all talk, no action, politician.
Truly doesn't have a clue!
Worst voting record in Sen..
@megynkelly, the @FoxNews   poll said very plainly I came in second in the debate.
All others, Time, Drudge, Slate etc.
said I came in 1st.
Great reception in D.C. At the Values Voter Summit.
Now checking on my job at the Old Post Office ..
Ahead of schedule and under budget!
Will be in Oklahoma tonight!
I am now inspecting the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue - will be a great hotel.
Soon off to the Oklahoma State Fair!
Dishonest @politico just called to say that none of the polls including Fox, NBC, CNN, Zogby, & Morning Consult matter.
Serious haters..
@MarcoRubio is weak on illegal immigration and will allow anyone into the country Has worst attendance record in Senate- rarely there to vote on a bill!
@THR "The Donald Trump Ratings Bump: Who's Benefiting Most"?
I will be on @cbs @60minutes this Sunday.
A great honor-- hope you enjoy it.
Just left Oklahoma--- the most amazing crowd and people!
What a night!
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is VERY weak on immigration, knows nothing about finance and would be incapable of making great trade deals!
Marco Rubio is a member of the Gang Of Eight or, very weak on stopping illegal immigration.
Only changed when poll numbers crashed.
Hope we all enjoy  @60Minutes tomorrow night.
I do believe they will treat me fairly!
Looking forward to press conference on taxes at 11AM at @TrumpTowerNY.
Thanks.
Will be doing @OutFrontCNN with @ErinBurnett tonight at 7 pm re: tax reductions and various other topics.
Conservative?
Jeb Bush doubled Florida State debt!
Wow, the ratings for @60Minutes last night were their biggest in a year--- very nice!
Do you believe this - Iran wants to trade our 3 prisoners (not 4) for 19 prisoners held by the U.S. Should have been let go with last deal!
Prediction: Rand Paul has been driven out of the race by my statements about him-- he will announce soon.
I hope when Rand Paul gets out of the race—he is at 1%--his supporters come over to me.
I will do a much better job for them.
Definitely watch @Carl_C_Icahn ‘s ‘Danger Ahead’.
Carl Icahn said this about me:  "I think at this moment in time, he’s the only candidate that speaks out about the country’s problems".
Great!
I watched lightweight Senator  Marco Rubio, who is all talk and no action, defend his WEAK position on illegal immigration.
Pathetic!
Just read that "Trump" has the largest (and I add most enthusiastic) crowds.
Tonight I will be in New Hampshire - the place will be packed!
Rubio is totally owned by the lobbyists and special interests.
A lightweight senator with the worst voting record in Senate.
Lazy!
Highly respected economist @Larry_Kudlow is a big fan of my tax plan—thank you Larry.
Anyone reading this profile of Marco Rubio would never vote for him.
Never made ten cents & is totally controlled!
Great news!
Just out--the highly respected USA Today/Suffolk University Poll.
Enjoy!
Wow, so nice!
Thank you Wayne Allyn Root.
Interesting, polls on who won the GOP debate.
I will be interviewed by @donlemon tonight on @CNN at 10PM.
Just got back from New Hampshire.
Great crowd, great people!
Will be back soon!
Thanks..
@MittRomney is trying to hit back at me because I'm saying that he let the Repub Party down w/ his loss to Obama.
Should've won—he choked!
I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10:00.
Many things, mostly bad, to talk about!
My warmest condolences to the families of the horrible Roseburg, Oregon, shootings.
I was so looking forward to being in Virginia Beach, Virginia, today.
The demand for tickets was amazing.
Good luck with storm, back soon!
Will be in Nashville, Tennessee, tomorrow (Saturday) at 2:30 P.M. So much to talk about - see you there!
Congratulations to my brother Robert & Ann Marie on the success of @MontesKitchen in Dutchess County, New York (Amenia.
) Great food!
Pictures of my beautiful mother, amazing father, and family hanging @MontesKitchen in upstate, New York.
Thank you @megynkelly for the nice things you said about Melania.
You will like her, great heart and smart - always wanting to help people!
Bush and Rubio are finally attacking each other, as I knew they would, in order to be the last "establishment" man standing against me.
Rubio was very disloyal to Bush, his mentor, when he decided to run against him.
Both said they "love" each other.
They don't - word is hate!
Just leaving Nashville, Tennessee.
Had a great time with a fabulous crowd of people!
Love Nashville -- back soon!
I will be on @MeetThePress with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning at 10:30am ET on @NBC.
Enjoy!
Tune in to see me on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos at 10am ET.
Enjoy!
The people of Tennessee yesterday were amazing.
Thank you!
I'm leading by big margins in every poll but the press keeps asking, would you ever get out?
They are just troublemakers, I'm going to win!
For all of my fantastic  supporters, and for the U.S.A., we are going to win and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, maybe greater than ever before!
The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension.
TPP is a terrible deal.
Thoughts and prayers for those in the floods affecting the great people of South Carolina.
Political strategist Stuart Stevens,who led Romney down the tubes in what should have been an easy victory,has terrible political instincts!
So, so, so important - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Don't ever forget, we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@WayneNewtonMrLV  Wayne, such a pleasant surprise--so nice.
Thank you very much.
Crooked @club4growth has given up advertising in Iowa on me—remember they wanted my million dollars—I said no—total frauds!
I will be on @SpecialReport with @BretBaier tonight at 6PM.
True!
Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims.
Not fair!
If Stuart Stevens' book is as bad as his horrible political advice to Mitt Romney, don't waste your money.
Arrogant guy but a zero!
Heading to a packed house in Waterloo, Iowa!
Will celebrate today's great poll numbers together.
See you soon!
I wonder why somebody doesn't do something about the clowns @politico and their totally dishonest reporting..
@politico has no power,  but so dishonest!
Just found out I won the Rockingham County Republican Booth Straw Poll at the Deerfield Fair in New Hampshire this past weekend..
@stuartpstevens made some of the dumbest political decisions of all time in helping Romney to get destroyed by Obama.
Should have won!
Iowa was amazing today.
Great crowd, great people.
Thanks, will be back soon!
Just arrived in Las Vegas for a packed house speech tomorrow.
Big poll results today, Leading big everywhere.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Wacky @glennbeck who always seems to be crying (worse than Boehner) speaks badly of me only because I refuse to do his show--a real nut job!
I hear @glennbeck is in big trouble.
Unlike me, his viewers & ratings are way down & he has become irrelevant—glad I didn’t do his show.
Wow, great news!
I hear @EWErickson of Red State was fired like a dog.
If you read his tweets, you'll understand why.
Just doesn't have IT!
What a time we all had in Iowa yesterday, massive overflow crowd.
Love them!
I'm at Trump Int'l Hotel in Las Vegas, tallest/most beautiful building in town.
Great, Kevin McCarthy drops out of SPEAKER race.
We need a really smart and really tough person to take over this very  important job!
Washington (D.C.) is such a mess - nothing works!
I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
It's not going to happen with anyone else.
'The goal is to be the winner': Donald Trump's campaign is for real.
Website Exposing Marco ‘Amnesty’ Rubio Goes Live: A ‘Donor Class Puppet’?
Thanks.
Thank you!
Just leaving Las Vegas.
Unbelievable crowd!
Many Hispanics who love me and I love them!
A great event in Las Vegas, Nevada!
@EWErickson is a total low life--- read his past tweets.
A dummy with no “it” factor.
Will fade fast..
@EWErickson ran @RedState into the ground.
A change was necessary.
Congratulations to @RedState and good luck in the future!
I was so happy when I heard that @Politico, one of the most dishonest political outlets, is losing a fortune.
Pure scum!
Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:20.
Great crowd in Las Vegas yesterday!
Good luck!
Enjoy.
Thanks Larry.
Best wishes.
I will be interviewed on @FacetheNation Sunday 10AM on CBS.
@johndickerson is a true pro!
Thanks.
True.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Good luck to the US Men’s National Team in tomorrow’s CONCACAF Cup vs.
Mexico!
It should be a great game!
Mark--They could use you.
Great Gravis Poll on the great state of NH.
Heading for Atlanta tomorrow morning for noon speech at North Atlanta Trade Center.
Big crowds, great people!
Paul Ryan is far from my first choice, but a very nice guy.
The Republicans should go for tough and (very) smart this time - no games!
I'm leading big in every poll and we are going to WIN!
Remember, Trump NEVER gives up!
@ChuckTodd just informed us that my interview last week on @MeetthePress was their highest rated show in 4 years.
Congrats!
Thank you Georgia!
I had a great afternoon with all of you!
I will be back soon..
@ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had fantastic numbers last Sunday --- Trump interview.
Nice!
Will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation with @JDickerson tomorrow at 10:30am EST.
Enjoy!
With the fantastic ratings last weekend, @meetthepress & @ThisWeekABC, I think it’s only fair that I go on @FoxNewsSunday w/ Chris Wallace.
Little Barry Diller, who lost a fortune on Newsweek and Daily Beast, only writes badly about me.
He is a sad and pathetic figure.
Lives lie!
Just got back from Georgia.
The crowds and love for U.S. was so amazing!
We all had a great day together - will be back soon!
I will be on Face The Nation (CBS) today at 10:30 A.M. and Media Buzz (Fox News) at 11:00 A.M. Enjoy!
President Obama was terrible on @60Minutes tonight.
He said CLIMATE CHANGE is the most important thing, not all of the current disasters!
Great, everyone is saying I did much better on @60Minutes  last week than President Obama did tonight.
I agree!
Leaving soon after a great time in New Hampshire, a truly special place!
Thank you.
Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity on @foxnews at 10PM tonight.
Enjoy!
At the request of many, and even though I expect it to be a very boring two hours, I will be covering the Democrat Debate live on twitter!
Someone should inform @CNN that, despite spending millions of $'s on graphics, it is not the Democratic Debate, rather the Democrat (s) D!
Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet.
I agree!
The arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at No Labels yesterday was a Jeb staffer!
HOW CAN HE BEAT RUSSIA & CHINA?
Everybody's talking about my doing twitter during the likely very boring debate tonight.
So nice, thank you very much.
How can Jeb Bush expect to deal with China, Russia + Iran if he gets caught doing a “plant” during my speech yesterday in NH?
It was just announced that I will be hosting Saturday Night Live on Nov.
Live from New York- November 7th!
We will all have fun and hopefully learn something tonight.
I will shoot straight and call it as I see it, both the good and the bad.
Enjoy!
Putin is not feeling too nervous or scared.
Get rid of all of these commercials.
The trade deal is a disaster, she was always for it!
Can anyone imagine Chafee as president?
No way.
O'Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance.
Who is winning the debate so far (just last name)?
All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage.
The hardest thing Clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including Iraq vote, e-mails etc.
Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!
Sanders said only black lives matter - wow!
Hillary did not answer question!
Check out OAN and compare to what you are watching now!
The latest book on Hillary—Wow, a really tough one!
Like her or not, Hillary did what she had to do in the debate last night—get through it.
Her opponents were very gentle and soft!
We need a strong leader- and fast!
The debate last night proved that Hillary is running against the “B” team.
She won’t be so lucky when it comes to me!
Will be going to Richmond, Virginia today.
Big crowd!
See you there.
Even though I have the legal right to use Steven Tyler’s song, he asked me not to.
Have better one to take its place!
Steven Tyler got more publicity on his song request than he’s gotten in ten years.
Good for him!
CNN/ORC Poll results just out for Nevada—WOW!
Just did @OReillyFactor.
Will be back on at 11pm on @FoxNews.
Incredible crowd in Richmond, Virginia tonight!
So much spirit and energy!
I'm very proud of my daughter Ivanka.
Great interview.
Signing my tax return....
A great day in New Jersey for Trump!
The @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party..
@CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials.
Will be on @bloombergtv tomorrow with @sruhle.
Enjoy!
Megyn Kelly has two really dumb puppets, Chris Stirewalt & Marc Threaten (a Bushy) who do exactly what she says..
@marcthiessen is a failed Bush speechwriter whose work was so bad that he has never been able to make a comeback.
A third rate talent!
Every poll, Time, Drudge, Slate and others, said I won both debates - but heard Megyn Kelly had her two puppets say bad stuff..
@CNBC has just agreed that the debate will be TWO HOURS.
Fantastic news for all, especially the millions of people who will be watching!
@EricTrump was FANTASTIC on @foxandfriends this morning.
He may be my son but he is a special guy!
@scottienhughes  Keep up the great work Scottie.
Polls are best ever!
A great new poll-33%!
Rumor has it that the grubby head of failing @VanityFair Magazine, "Sloppy" Graydon Carter, is going to be fired or replaced very soon?
Heading to Boston to see another huge crowd!
My friend Tom Brady is a great competitor and golf partner.
In Massachusetts --- the place is packed!
@JebBush, At the debate you said your brother kept us safe- I wanted to be nice & did not mention the WTC came down during his watch, 9/11.
No @JebBush, you’re pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brother’s term when the World Trade Center was attacked and came down..
@JebBush, like it or not, our country needs more energy and spirit than you can provide!
@KatrinaPierson, you did a fantastic job tonight on @FoxNews.
Thank you for your very tough and very smart representation!
Thank you @thefix for your very honest commentary.
One thing, we do have great teams in IA, NH, SC and beyond..
@HillaryClinton is on the front page of the @nytimes waving to 200 people in New Hampshire.
My crowd next door was 5,000 people – no pic!
Russia and the world has already started to respect us again!
A great story in the New York Post ---really well written!
I will be interviewed on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace at 9:00 A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on location).
Will be tough but good!
Good news for those that want to Make America Great Again - I am winning every poll in every STATE and NATIONAL - and by big numbers!
Amazing!
Thank you!
On at 9:00A.M. or 10:00 A.M. (depending on your location)  on Fox is a tough but really good interview with Chris Wallace.
Enjoy!
Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them.
Also, Rubio is hitting him hard!
This morning Chris Wallace has the best political show on television - but that's only because I'm on it (kidding)!
Have fun.
Jeb, why did your brother attack and destabalize the Middle East by attacking Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction?
Bad info?
@MittRomney  can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible "choke" loss to Obama!
@MittRomney and his campaign manager should not be critical of candidates after they blew an election that should never have been lost!
Does everyone remember   @MittRomney and his famous remarks about "self-deportation" and "47%".
He was done.
I don't need his angry advice!
I should release the sad and totally apologetic letter that Penn @pennjillette hand delivered to me.
Minds would be changed very fast!
Replay of Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace at 2:00 P.M. on @FoxNews.
Big statement made by Chris!
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace at 2:00 P.M. on @FoxNews - Turn off the football for 15 minutes, Make America Great Again!
It's amazing that some of the dumbest people on television work for the Wall Street Journal, in particular a real dope named Charles Lane!
Just reported by CNN that "the Trump halo effect"  caused a record-shattering Democratic Debate rating of 15.3 million viewers.
So true!
Best thing my supporters can do if you don't like the way @megynkelly and her puppets unfairly treat "us" is don't watch her show!
It's really cold outside, they are calling it a major freeze, weeks ahead of normal.
Man, we could use a big fat dose of global warming!
Jeb is fighting to defend a catastrophic event.
I am fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again.
NEW POLL: Trump Blue Collar Support highest since FDR in 1930s--WOW!
See, the attack  very possibly could have been stopped.
We need real leadership and vision.
Tonight's official count--7,943.
An all time record for the Anderson Civic Center in SC!
Thanks!
I will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10 PM @FoxNews.
Lots of great new polls--big leads!
Both Aberdeen and Turnberry in Scotland, and the soon to open Doonbeg in Ireland, blow Bandon Dunes away.
Bandon is a toy by comparison!
I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10:00.
You will find it very interesting (I hope).
Enjoy!
@KarlRove  Had my best day ever in the polls, one had me at 41% - Morning Consult.
Boston Globe, Monmouth, NBC and CNN all great.
More!
@seanhannity at 10:00.
I will be interviewed on @GMA Good Morning America tomorrow at 7:00 A.M. Big new ABC poll coming out - I hope I do well!
@MonicaCrowley you were GREAT on @seanhannity tonight.
Thank you for the nice words!
Just out: Boston Herald/Franklin Pierce Poll  N.H.  TRUMP 28 (up 10)  CARSON 16  BUSH 9  RUBIO 6  CRUZ 5  Press will say they are surging!
I will be interviewed on @GMA Good Morning America at 7:00 A.M. @ABC will be announcing new poll numbers.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
New poll by ABC News/Washington Post  TRUMP 32  CARSON 22  RUBIO 10  BUSH 7  Wow, how will the media put a negative spin on this one?
I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family.
Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.
Can u believe that Jeb Bush’s campaign manager is in Berlin, Germany looking for money?
What’s he giving to Germany?
Joe, thanks for not running!
The young intern who accidentally did a Retweet apologizes.
Remember, official campaign merchandise (hats, apparel etc.
So nice of @Cher--- greatly appreciated!
Crowd was amazing tonight at Trump National Doral in Miami.
Love and excitement in the ballroom.
Tomorrow at noon in Jacksonville!
Massive crowds already forming in Jacksonville - will be and incredible day - 12 noon!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Leaving for Jacksonville now.
See you there!
Miami was great.
Saying goodbye to some of my great workers at @TrumpDoral in Miami.
Just finished speaking in Jacksonville, Florida.
Incredible crowd, fantastic people.
Thank you!
Will be doing a sit down interview with  @JakeTapper @CNN on Sunday morning at 9:00.
Tough questions and hopefully very good answers!
I will be doing the @TodayShow live from New Hampshire at 7am on Monday morning.
Expecting a great crowd of amazing people.
Questions will be live!
@JebBush is totally lost -- he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign & not enough talking about America's future..
@JebBush had a tiny 300 person crowd at Senator Tim Scott's forum.
I had thousands, and they had real passion!
@JebBush is slashing campaign salaries, people making millions.
If he can't manage his campaign, how can he manage our countries finances?
While Jeb Bush is cutting staff and salaries, after having paid ridiculous amounts of money, why did he pay so much in the first place?
I will be doing a major sit down interview on State of the Union With Jake Tapper at 9:00 A.M. on @CNN.
Enjoy!
This is just not the right time for Jeb Bush.
His campaign is in total disarray, too much staff being paid way too much money = U.S. GOVT.
A big POLL will be announced this morning on @CBSNews  Face The Nation.
I wonder if I do well if the press will report the results?
I spell out some of the differences between Ben Carson and myself at 9:00 A.M. on @CNN @jaketapper.
Ben is very weak on illegal immigration.
Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse).
I have created tens of thousands of jobs, it's what I do.
Watch @CNN at 9:00 A.M. @jaketapper.
Then interviewed on @ABC @GStephanopoulos at 10:00 A.M. and then, at 10:30 A.M., watch Face The Nation.
Big poll comes out today on Face The Nation at 10:30 on @CBSNews.
Watch my interview on @CBSNews Face The Nation now and, also, the new CBS POLLS which, if good for me, the media won't report!
@CBSNews Poll - WOW!
Do you believe that @FoxNews is still playing up the old Iowa poll numbers and no mention of the ABCWashington Post or just out CBS results?
@ByronYork  Great numbers from @CBSNews Poll.
Also from ABC-Washington Post Poll.
Thank you!
Do you think I will get credit for keeping Ford in U.S. Who cares, my supporters know the truth.
Think what can be done as president!
Remember that Carson, Bush and Rubio are VERY weak on illegal immigration.
They will do NOTHING to stop it.
Our country will be overrun!
An aerial shot of Jacksonville crowd yesterday!
I may as well show you because the media won't.
Leaving for New Hampshire now.
Will be doing the @TODAYshow there, live at 7:00 A.M. New @CBSNews Poll of New Hampshire: Trump 38 Carson 12!
Ben Carson wants to abolish Medicare - I want to save it and Social Security.
This whole Super PAC scam is very unfair to a person like me who has disavowed all PAC's & is self-funding.
Re Super PAC scam:  What the other candidates are doing is a disgrace.
All Presidential candidates should immediately disavow their Super PAC’s.
Dopey @BillKristol, who has lost all credibility with so many dumb statements and  picks, said last week on @Morning_Joe that Biden was in.
New Gravis national poll just out --- 36%!
Very nice!
Thank you @SahilKapur for the wonderful story.
National GOP Presidential Poll via @OANN @realDonaldTrump 35.
I am leaving for Sioux City, Iowa - great event (rally).
Just out, wonderful poll in North Carolina.
Thank you Iowa!
Great night---see you soon!
After a great evening and packed auditorium in Iowa, I am now in Colorado looking forward to what I am sure will be a very unfair debate!
@CNBC continues to report fictious poll numbers.
Number one, based on every statistic, is Trump (by a wide margin).
They just can't say it!
@Morning_Joe can you believe Kasie Hunt's poor and purposely inaccurate reporting on my great night and crowd in Iowa.
@politico is a scam!
Does anybody think that @CNBC will get their fictitious  polling numbers corrected sometime prior to the start of the debate.
Sad!
I'm sure the media will not report the highly respected new national poll that just came out via The Economist..
@TheEconomist Poll, one of the most highly respected, was just released.
Wow, wait until the media digests these numbers - won't be happy!
Thanks everyone, they all said  I won the debate.
Even won the @CNBC Poll!
Thank you!
Thanks, @PiersMorgan.
You're great!
Thank you, Jonathan.
Greatly appreciated!
Thank you Colorado!
The money losing @politico is considered by many in the world of politics to be the dumbest and most slanted of the political sites.
Losers!
Thank you @morningmika and @JoeNBC  for all of your nice words and comments on the debate!
Thank you to everybody for your wonderful comments on my debate performance - it was a lot of fun!
Today I will be speaking in Reno, Nevada.
Thank you!
Failing host @glennbeck, a mental basketcase, loves SUPERPACS - in other words, he wants your politicians totally controlled by lobbyists!
@SpeakerRyan Congratulations and good luck - you will do a GREAT job for our wonderful U.S.A.!
Join me Tuesday, Nov.
I’ll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA.
Don’t miss it!
Post-Debate via @OANN.
Thank you!
My interview on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had a 40%+ ratings increase over same Sunday last year.
Wow, just heard really bad stuff about the failing  @politico.
How much longer  will they be around?
Some very untalented reporters.
Loved doing the debate last night on @CNBC.
Check out all of the polls!
Everyone agrees that Harwood bombed!
Thank you @CharlesHurt for  the nice words on @seanhannity.
I will win and Make America Great Again!
Thank you @Morning_Joe for explaining to @CNN and @andersoncooper and so many others that I am leading in almost all national & state polls.
Happy Birthday to my wonderful daughter, @IvankaTrump.
Thank you @rushlimbaugh for your wonderful words.
Super PACs should be disavowed by anyone running for President.
They are a total scam on our system and country!
I am self-funding.
Happy Birthday to my friend @garyplayer....
@GovMikeHuckabee Great job on @FoxNews tonight.
Thanks for your nice words about my children.
Class!
When candidate John Kasich, on the @oreillyfactor, talked about dismantling Medicare and Medicaid, he was referring to Ben Carson.
I am going to save Medicare and Medicaid, Carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate Gov.
John Kasich doesn't have a clue - weak!
Black Lives Matter protesters totally disrupt Hillary Clinton event.
She looked lost.
This is not what we need with ISIS, CHINA, RUSSIA etc.
The new NBC POLL has me in first place but said I was third in the debate - I demand a recount (just kidding!
).
I see Marco Rubio just landed another billionaire to give big money to his Superpac, which are total scams.
Marco must address him as "SIR"!
I am leaving for Norfolk, Virginia - the great battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin - for a big rally and really big crowd.
See you soon!
I told you so-@politico just lost it's top person.
Poor results and no money to pay him.
If they were legit, they would be doing far better!
Lifting off right now for U.S.S. Wisconsin in Norfolk.
The @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me.
They better be careful or I will unleash big time on them.
Look forward to it!
@ColinCowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I'd do his show, @TheHerd, on Monday (2:30pm EST).
Just left Virginia where I unveiled my healthcare and other plans for our great Veterans!
They will be very happy!
Support Coach Kennedy and his right, together with his young players, to pray on the football field.
Liberty Institute just suspended him!
Thank you James Freeman of the @WSJ for the very nice words.
All polls said I won the debate except NBC (3rd).
Explain to Daniel Henninger!
No complaints but how many people would be watching these really dumb but record setting debates if I wasn't in them?
Interesting question!
Few people know that  @FortuneMagazine is still in business..
@thehill  John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show.
I said "NO THANKS" Waste of time & energy!
Gov.
John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail.
I thought he would have been far more talented.
He is just wasting time & money!
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's, Mr. Amnesty, endorsement.
Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it".
I never thought of Jeb as a crook!
Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other.
Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
Marco Rubio will not win.
Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".
If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate.
BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
Join me Tuesday Nov.
While in politics it is often smart to send out false messages, one thing is clear:  That Hillary does not want to run against TRUMP.
Sirius National News at 7:30 A.M. Steve Bannon..
@Morning_Joe: Marco only won the debate in the minds of desperate people.
I won every on-line poll, even crazy @CNBC.
Marco good looking?
Thank you Carl Higbie (former Navy Seal) for you support of my plan to straighten out the Veterans Administration-a mess!
Meet me at @TrumpTowerNY and get your copy of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA signed on 11/3 at 12pm!
@CharlesMBlow  Why don’t you use new polls instead of the single ancient national poll that was a tiny bit negative.
Dishonest reporting!
@megynkelly used this poll (nobody else did) when I was down—wonder if she’ll use it now that I’m up?
My interview with @jheil & @MarkHalperin at @WollmanRink airing at 5PM on @bpolitics.
Join me tomorrow, Nov.
I will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. and @foxandfriends at 7:50.
Talking about my new book, out today, Crippled America..
@CharlesGKoch is looking for a new puppet after Governor Walker and Jeb Bush cratered.
He now likes Rubio--next fail.
Marco Rubio would keep Barack Obama’s executive order on amnesty intact.
See article.
Cannot be President.
Isn't it terrible that @megynkelly used a poll not used before (I.B.D.) when I was down, but refuses to use it now when I am up?
Just landed in New Hampshire - a very exciting morning planned!
Wow!
@FoxNews poll just came out.
I will unveil my first campaign ads on @Morning_Joe at 6:30am tomorrow.
Enjoy!
Also, tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am.
Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio, "he's my friend"!
Pure political speak.
Why can't he be truthful and say "disloyal guy, no friend"!
@seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I "ran for president twice".
Never ran, merely considered running!
Rubio lied about my meeting w/ Hispanic activists.
I didn’t change my opinion but treated them w/ respect.
Shame!
The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!
A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio.
So do two people who worked with him.
Said he used the wrong credit card!
Sure.
Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson "is trying to solidify his lead".
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
Carson now admits his friend named "Bob," who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!
), no longer exists as Bob.
Wrong name!
I think it would be a good idea—and fair—to include @GovChristie & @MikeHuckabeeGOP in the debate.
Both solid & good guys..
@AJDelgado13 Thank you so much for the nice words and support--really enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts.
Getting ready for @nbcsnl commercial.
Happy Birthday to the great @BillyGraham.
He's done so many wonderful things, not the least of which is his fantastic family.
I love Billy!
So sad that Obama rejected Keystone Pipeline.
Thousands of jobs, good for the environment, no downside!
Will be on @oreillyfactor tonight.
Signing a copy of Crippled America for Bill!
Would be nice if @jmartNYT learned how to read the polls before writing his next story.
Probably done on purpose, but not good reporting!
One of the dumbest political pundits on television is Chris Stirewalt of @FoxNews..
@RobertGBeckel Please thank your brother for his nice words on television.
Seems like a great guy and character!
Saturday Night Live has some incredible things in store tonight.
The great thing about playing myself is that it will be authentic!
They are saying that tickets to tonight's Saturday Night Live are the hardest to get in the history of this great show!
Off to a good start!
I am at the Saturday Night Live Studio - electricity all over the place.
We will be doing a "tweeting" skit, so stay tuned!
Amazing evening at Saturday Night Live!
@nbcsnl - So much fun last night!
@CNN  Will be interviewed by Jake Tapper at 9:00 A.M. Enjoy.
At 10:30 I will be interviewed on both @meetthepress by @chucktodd and @CBSNews Face The Nation by John Dickerson.
This after long evening!
Television ratings for @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live just came out and they were great - the best since 2011.
Very few protesters!
@EricShawnonFox Highest rated Saturday Night Live in four years.
Thank you to all of those who gave me such wonderful reviews for my performance on @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live.
Best ratings in 4 years!
@Betsy_McCaughey Thanks so much.
Really appreciate your comments.
I will help the veterans like no one else..
@CNN  should listen.
Ana Navarro has no talent, no TV persona, and works for Bush—a total conflict of interest.
Thanks Piers.
Greatly appreciated.
Great job on @Greta @DonaldJTrumpJr.
Nobody could have done it better!
A great evening in Springfield, Illinois.
Thank you for all of the support!
Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician!
Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat & chugging water.
He choked!
Marco Rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration & in favor of easy amnesty.
I will be interviewed by @GStephanopoulos on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. There is much to talk about!
Go out and buy CRIPPLED AMERICA: How to Make America Great Again.
Doing really well.
Great Thanksgiving or Christmas present!
Thank you New Jersey!
Thank you South Carolina!
I will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire tomorrow at 7am.
Will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire - 7:00 A.M. Talking about the debate and more!
Loved doing the debate...
won Drudge and all on-line polls!
Amazing evening, moderators did an outstanding job.
Thank you @Morning_Joe & @morningmika -- a great show!
Happy Veterans Day.
To those who have served, thank you for your special work.
Just returned home from the great state of New Hampshire.
Have made so many friends there--special place!
I never said that China was in the bad TPP trade deal but that China would come in the back door at a later date..
@gerardtbaker Gerard—wonderful job last night as moderator of the debate.
I told many, “really smart and elegant”.
I will be on @marklevinshow at 8PM tonight.
Tune in!
Will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight at 8 PM.
All seven on-line polls, including Drudge and Time, with thousands of respondents, said I won the debate.
@krauthammer said I was "so, so".
Today's @WSJ Editorial is WRONG again.
I know that China is not in the new T.P.P. trade deal but would come in latter through a back door..
@WSJ Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and T.P.P. and apologize.
China not part but will get their way in later.
The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often.
They got info from an incorrect story in another pub.
Why not watch and listen to debate.
When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me.
I want "smart" trade deals.
Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong.
No wonder it is doing poorly!
We, as a country, either have borders or we don't.
IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!
@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP.
Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?
@WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal.
Total fool @KarlRove is part of the Republican Establishment problem.
An all talk, no action dummy!
Wow, pres.
candidate Ben Carson, who is very weak on illegal Immigration, just said  he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship.
From 2% to 27% in Texas - quite a jump into first place!
Thank you @Forbes for showing the @WSJ was wrong.
So dishonest!
Macy’s was very disloyal to me bc of my strong stance on illegal immigration.
Their stock has crashed!
I will be on with @BretBaier tonight at 6PM.
I will be on @OutFrontCNN with @ErinBurnett at 7PM.
Tune in!
First candidate in Virginia with over 16,000 validated signatures for the ballot.
An honor - thank you!
Thank you Iowa!
I appreciate all of your support @IowaCentral & @ethanolbyPOET this evening!
@CarlyFiorina Carly, not just you, I also told Gov.
Kasich to “let Jeb talk, give him a chance” because Kasich was constantly cutting in..
@CarlyFiorina Carly—I did graduate from Wharton and did very well.
Who is your fact checker?
Will you apologize?
@CarlyFiorina  Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease.
I didn’t say it, he did.
Apology?
@CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with Putin—never said I was in Green Room.
Separate pieces—great ratings!
@CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign!
@seanhannity  Carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope!
Sad.
Great honor to be inducted into the NJ Boxing Hall of Fame last night.
Thank you!
Timing could not have been better!
Thank you @JakeTapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields.
Should have been done long ago.
They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields.
Now they are not laughing and doing what I said.
Boy is this guy @ShepNewsTeam tough on me.
So totally biased.
As a reporter, he should be ashamed of himself!
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks.
May God be with you all.
President Obama said "ISIL continues to shrink" in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris.
He is just so bad!
CHANGE.
We need much tougher, much smarter leadership - and we need it NOW!
Great news out of New Hampshire!
DonaldTrump is pulling away from the pack w/ 2nd is 17% behind him!
Why won't President Obama use the term Islamic Terrorism?
Isn't it now, after all of this time and so much death, about time!
Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage?
O'Malley is a clown.
Wow, Bernie Sanders just admitted that the real unemployment rate is 10% (it is actually over 20%) and for  African American youth - 51%.
I think everyone will like my new and very successful book, Crippled America.
Go get it and let me know what you think!
When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM?
He  can't say it, and unless he will,  the problem will not be solved!
@realDonaldTrump on ISIS&OIL FIELDS!
Saying it for years!
@AndersonCooper, you should acknowledge this!
I had a great time in Texas yesterday.
A tremendous crowd of wonderful and enthusiastic people.
Will be back soon!
We need strong, tough and brilliant leadership now more than ever!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@VanityFair Magazine is doing really poorly.
It has gotten worse and worse over the years, and has lost almost all of it's former allure!
I have watched sloppy Graydon Carter fail and close Spy Magazine and now am watching him fail at @VanityFair Magazine.
He is a total loser!
Glad to see that @RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night.
Was soundly beaten - not a nice person!
@JohnLegere  @TMobile  John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible!
Try hiring some good managers.
President Obama just told President Putin how important the Russian air strikes against ISIS have been.
I TOLD YOU SO!
Tom Brady just did it again.
He is not only a great guy, he is, without question, the BEST quarterback!
Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago.
Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.
Wow, @Macys shares are down more than 40% this year.
I never knew my ties & shirts not being sold there would have such a big impact!
Republicans must stop listening to dopes like @KarlRove who still insists Mitt Romney won the last election.
Think big & think strong!
Will be landing in Knoxville, Tennessee shortly - tremendous crowd expected.
I agree!
The headline says it all.
Just landing in Knoxville, Tennessee!
Massive crowd expected!
Will all have a great time, despite serious subject matter.
Just leaving Knoxville, TN --- what a crowd, what amazing people!
Great poll numbers out of @UMassAmherst.
Thank you!
Just received a copy of @SarahPalinUSA new book -- a great read!
Sarah is a terrific person.
Thank you Tennessee!
So many great polls like Reuters - big leads everywhere.
New Hampshire really special!
We will win big and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I, along with almost everyone else, have so little confidence in President Obama.
Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country.
Who knows who they are - some could be ISIS.
Is our president insane?
What is our President doing?
One of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great @AP.
They have lost their way and are no longer credible..
@AP is doing very badly.
I can say from experience their reporting is terrible & highly inaccurate.
Sadly, they are now irrelevant!
Melania and I just had interview with the legendary @BarbaraJWalters.
I will be interviewed by  @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 on @FoxNews .
Much, much, much to talk about!
The great Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a Special Friday night at 10:00 on ABC.
Thank you for all of your support!
How does Ben Carson survive this problem – really big.
Similar story on front page of New York Times.
Eight Syrians were just caught on the southern border trying to get into the U.S. ISIS maybe?
I told you so.
WE NEED A BIG & BEAUTIFUL WALL!
Everyone is now saying how right I was with illegal immigration & the wall.
After Paris, they’re all on the bandwagon.
The POLICE in Paris did a fantastic job.
Very brave - not easy!
Thank you for your support!
I told you!
Premiums are soaring!
Just the beginning & it is going to get worse.
Rates & deductibles are so high nobody is going to be able to use it.
Thank you Worcester, Massachusetts!
The legendary Barbara Walters interviews Melania Trump and me on a special this Friday night at 10:00 on ABC.
Don't miss it!
Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls.
Pathetic!
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down.
People from NH are smart!
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last!
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he’s almost last.
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it.
Shame!
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud!
John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives.
A total failure!
A great evening in Iowa!
Thank you Des Moines Area Community College for a great forum!
A wonderful afternoon in Iowa!
Great people!
Heading now to Florida - tomorrow, South Carolina!
The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders "MASTERMINDS".
Call them instead thugs and losers.
Young people must not go into ISIS!
The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it.
These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds!
Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd.
Iowa was amazing yesterday!
@mkhammer, a Fox contributor, isn't smart enough to know what is going on at the border.
@TheJuanWilliams made the point far better!
My family has the honor of being interviewed for a full hour by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters tonight @ABC - 10pmE.
I didn't suggest a database-a reporter did.
Thank you for a great afternoon, South Carolina!
See you next Tuesday!
The legendary @BarbaraJWalters interviews my family and me tonight at 10:00 on @ABC2020 .
Don't miss it!
Just got back from South Carolina.
Going to Alabama tomorrow!
@Gracematters Thank you, a very wise bet!
Best wishes..
@washingtonpost  @BretBaier  Please thank Charles Lane for his new found confidence.
He has made a very good bet!
Tune into the legendary @BarbaraJWalters at 10pmE on @ABC2020 tonight.
Looking forward to watching the legendary @BarbaraJWalters interview my family (and me) tonight on @ABC at 10:00.
Many things to talk about!
Join us at 10pmE on @ABC2020 @ABC with @BarbaraJWalters!
People are really liking my new book, "Crippled America".
Check it out!
We're stuck with the worst mayor in the United States.
Too bad, but New York City will survive!
To show you how politicians act, Bobby Jindal spent $1,000 to register in New Hampshire & dropped out the next day.
Such a waste!
Heading to Birmingham, Alabama, and a massive crowd of incredible people!
A woman who got fired after two days of working with Scott Walker - a wacko - now trying to raise funds to fight me.
So nice when media properly polices media.
Thank you @BreitbartNews.
Rumor has it - Pataki, Kasich, & Senator Lindsey Graham are dropping out of the race very soon.
Hope it's not true, they're so easy to beat!
Thank you John Nolte for  wonderful analysis & reporting.
It's too bad so few people showed up to @bobvanderplaats Family Leader dinner.
Next year I'll try & be there- and they'll have a huge crowd!
Thank you for a great afternoon Birmingham, Alabama!
Thank you to all law enforcement agencies for a fabulous job!
@heytana, great job - we are all proud of you!
ccolvinj @AP is one of the truly bad reporters---working for an organization that has totally lost its way.
Stories are fictional garbage.
I find that @Reuters is a far more professional operation than @AP..
Big new @ABC Poll to be announced at 9:00 A.M. on This Week with @GStephanopoulos.
I will be interviewed on show!
Great poll numbers all over and beating Hillary Clinton one on one.
Thank you!
How many made it?
WE NEED THE WALL!
We better get tough with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS, and get tough now, or the life and safety of our wonderful country will be in jeopardy!
Great poll numbers!
Thank you!
Hillary Clinton is weak on illegal immigration, among many other things.
She is strong on corruption - corruption is what she's best at!
@MatthewJDowd thank you for the nice comments recently, especially on @BarbaraJWalters.
My family & I greatly appreciate your kind words..
@AP continues to do extremely dishonest reporting.
Always looking for a hit to bring them back into relevancy—ain’t working!
@AP has one of the worst reporters in the business -- @JeffHorwitz wouldn’t know the truth if it hit him in the face.
Going to Columbus, Ohio today for a tremendous rally of thousands.
The silent majority is no longer silent!
When you do your Christmas shopping remember how disloyal @Macys was to the subject of illegal immigration..
@WSJ reports that @GOP getting ready to treat me unfairly—big spending planned against me.
That wasn’t the deal!
Going to Ohio, home of one of the worst presidential candidates in history--Kasich.
Heading for Ohio - really big crowd of amazing people!
Much to talk about!
Just left Columbus rally of 14,000 people --- a far bigger crowd than even I expected!
Unbelievable evening, incredible spirit in the arena!
Republicans must stop relying on losers like @KarlRove if they want to start winning presidential elections.
Be tough and get smart!
Heading to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
Really big crowd—so much to talk about!
Will be doing @seanhannity at 10 PM on @FoxNews.
As always with Sean, will be interesting!
@BradPaisley came up to see me.
A really nice and talented guy.
What is Frank VanderSloot getting for agreeing to back Marco Rubio?
Last victim was Mitt Romney - see how that turned out.
Thank you for your nice words @MikeNeedham @Heritage for the nice words on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace.
New @OANN national poll released.
Thank you America!
A wonderful evening in South Carolina - big crowd, amazing energy!
Why would @greta use @KarlRove as an election analyst when he has made so many mistakes.
He still thinks Romney won.
An establishment dope!
South Carolina was so great last night.
Will be back soon!
Thank you for your continued support!
I LIVE IN NEW JERSEY & @realDonaldTrump IS RIGHT: MUSLIMS DID CELEBRATE ON 9/11 HERE!
WE SAW IT!
The failing @nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on Donald Trump!
The @nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control.
With unfunded liabilities-big trouble!
The dopes at the @nytimes bought the Boston Globe for $1.3 billion and sold it for $1.00.
Their great old headquarters-gave it away!
So, since the people at the @nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade, why do people care what they write.
Incompetent!
The numbers at the @nytimes  are so dismal, especially advertising revenue, that big help will be needed fast.
A once great institution-SAD!
Happy Thanksgiving to all.
Have a great day and look forward to the future.
We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Great new poll numbers!
Thank you for your support!
I do not know the reporter for the @nytimes, or what he looks like.
I was showing a person groveling to take back a statement made long ago!
The failing @nytimes should focus on fair and balanced reporting rather than constant hit jobs on me.
Yesterday 3 boring articles, today2!
Pollster Trend  National GOP Average 223 national polls & 33 pollsters.
I will be going to Sarasota, Florida, today for a big rally with amazing people!
I have one goal on mind: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The reporter who pulled-back from his 14 year old never retracted story is having fun.
I don't know what he looks like and don't know him!
Virtually no-one has spent more money in helping the  American people with disabilities than me.
We boarded the helicopter for Sarasota earlier & will be landing soon!
See you there.
Sarasota was an unbelievable success.
We expected 5,000, a record, but 12,000 showed up!
Great love in the air!
@CNN Kayleigh McEnany was great on you network today.
You should have her  on more often!
Thank you Kayleigh for your nice words.
The Sarasota, Florida, rally today was amazing.
It's going to happen, this is a MOVEMENT!
I will be on @meetthepress in an interview with @chucktodd on Sunday morning.
So much to talk about!
@CNN has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.
Just watched Cookie Roberts on @ABC.
Her predictions have been so wrong for so long that she has lost all credibility.
Will be meeting on Monday at Trump Tower with a large group of African American Pastors.
Many I know-wonderful people!
Not a press event.
After my meeting with the pastors, it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement!
Great job @MariaTCardona on @ThisWeekABC.
You made kooky Cokie Roberts and @BillKristol look even dumber than they are.
You will be right!
When will @CNN get some real political talent rather than political commentators like Errol Louis, who doesn't have a clue!
Others bad also.
Wow, the MSM is really going after me.
Only one negativity - they only want negatives!
How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ, which is deeply troubled, when he is spending all of his time in NH?
New Jerseyans not happy!
We better be vigilant, careful, and strong.
We need a great leader- now!
Meeting with African American Pastors at Trump Tower was amazing.
Wonderful news conference followed.
Now off to Georgia for big speech!
A great night in Macon, Georgia!
Thank you for all of the support.
A signed copy of CRIPPLED AMERICA makes a great gift.
I want to thank all my friends in Macon for the special evening and great reception.
What a crowd of incredible people!
Jamiel Shaw was incredible on @foxandfriends this morning.
His son, who was viciously killed by an illegal immigrant, is so proud of pop!
Look at the editorial I was just sent from the NY Post on 9/14/01 - 3 days after collapse of WTC.
Any apologies?
Curtis Sliwa - doing tv commentary on 9/13/2001.
Good job Curtis.
Please send your apologies to @realDonaldTrump.
What is Obama thinking?
Highly untalented Wash Post blogger, Jennifer Rubin, a real dummy, never writes fairly about me.
Why does Wash Post have low IQ people?
You would think a paper like the Washington Post would be fair and objective.
For the record, almost all polls showed I won all debates.
Just arrived in New Hampshire.
Another packed venue!
Will be fun.
The truth continues to come out after 14 years.
A truth that many in the media did not want to tell.
I WILL BE ON @foxandfriends  AT 7:30 -NOW!
Order signed copy of CRIPPLED AMERICA & submit a question for my live streaming book signing on 12/3 at 7:30 pm.
Join me at 2:00pmEST today - live from Trump Tower - via Facebook & Periscope!
I beat Hillary in the new @FoxNews Poll head to head.
SHE HAS NO STRENGTH OR STAMINA, both of which are needed to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you CBS & Breitbart-total vindication!
Will the mainstream media apologize?
Many, many witnesses.
California shooting looks very bad.
Good luck to law enforcement and God bless.
This is when our police are so appreciated!
A signed copy of CRIPPLED AMERICA is the ultimate gift.
Heading to Manassas, Virginia, for a rally.
Will have a moment of silence for the victims of the California shootings.
So sad!
Congratulations on the GREAT job done by POLICE and law enforcement on the California shootings.
Give credit where credit is due.
I consider my health, stamina and strength one of my greatest assets.
The world has watched me for many years and can so testify-great genes!
CRIPPLED AMERICA is perfect gift for friends & family.
Loved being in Manassas, VA last night.
Such incredible spirit!
Now in DC for a speech, will then visit Old Post Office under construction.
Why can't @Politico get better reporters than Ben Schreckenger?
Guy is a major lightweight with no credibility.
So dishonest!
CRIPPLED AMERICA is the perfect gift for friends & family.
Order signed copy & join me at 7:30pm, live streaming!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Vote in 2016!
Thank you so much for the wonderful article, Robert Davi.
It was recently reported that 3rd rate $ losing @Politico is a foil for the Clintons.
Questions given to Clinton in advance.
No credibility.
Great to see the construction of the Old Post Office on Penn Ave.
Going fast - under budget, ahead of schedule!
Thank you, New Hampshire!
Great people -- see you next week!
Thank you!!
Purchase your copy of CRIPPLED AMERICA now & be on potential call list for my live streaming signing event tonite.
I invite you to join my campaign to Make America Great Again!
Sign up to Volunteer!
Watch my live book signing now!
@MarkHalperin I totaly won the RJC meeting yesterday.
Know many members who said "not even close"..
@CNN Poll just came out, amazing numbers for those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
TRUMP 36%, a 20 point lead over 2nd place.
Thanks..
@CNN & @CNNPolitics Please thank Alisyn Camerota, David Chalian and John King for the very professional reporting of the new CNN Poll.
The virtually incompetent Republican Strategist who has had a failed career, Cheri Jacobus, is incoherent with anger that her puppets died!
Great Live Signing last nite!
Over 25k views.
I am signing books for next two weeks..
@marthamaccallum  Martha, great interview with my son @EricTrump -- smart, tough & professional.
Thank you!
The horrible shooting that took place in San Bernardino was an absolute act of terror that many people knew about.
Why didn’t they report?
@JRubinBlogger one of the dumber bloggers @washingtonpost only writes purposely inaccurate pieces on me.
She is in love with Marco Rubio?
Congratulations, Chuck.
Good news, disloyal @Macys stock is in a total free fall.
Don't shop there for Christmas!
Great Live Signing last nite!
Over 25k views.
I am signing books for next two weeks.
Order yours for holiday gifts.
A great night in Raleigh, North Carolina!
THANK YOU!
Raleigh, North Carolina, was fantastic last night.
Such incredible spirit.
We all want to, and will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Done by a real fan!
Re CRIPPLED AMERICA  -- I am signing books for the next two weeks.
Order yours for holiday gifts!
A great day in both Spencer & Davenport, Iowa!
THANK YOU for the support!
@KatyTurNBC, 3rd rate reporter & @SopanDeb @ CBS lied.
Finished in normal manner&signed autos for 20min.
Dishonest!
@KatyTurNBC & @DebSopan should be fired for dishonest reporting.
Thank you @GatewayPundit for reporting the truth.
Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST?
Was going to do a phoner this morning with @jaketapper on @CNN but they could not get their phone equipment to hook in.
Will do next week.
I will be interviewed on Face The Nation @CBSNews at 10:30 A.M. Should be interesting - ENJOY!
Hillary just said that she will not use the term "radical Islamic" - but was incapable of saying why.
She is afraid of  Obama & the e-mails!
Watch Face The Nation - will be on now!
So, how did I do on Face The Nation?
@BrookslawBrooks  Thank you so much for your nice words.
I will make you look very smart!
I will be live-tweeting President Obama's prime-time speech tonight starting at 7:50 P.M. (Eastern).
Will he finally state the real problems?
Wow, @GeorgeWill said some very nice things about me today on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace.
I am making progress, thanks George!
Thank you America!
Order my book CRIPPLED AMERICA for your holiday gifts.
I will be signing books for the next two weeks!
I have been saying it for sometime now!
May the Festival of Lights bring our Jewish friends from around the world, health & happiness!
Happy Hanukkah!
Gee, @meetthepress with @chucktodd was getting terrible ratings then, with me,  he set records - I saved his job, but Chuck still not nice!
BIG NIGHT ON TWITTER TONIGHT.
I WILL BE LIVE TWEETING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH AT 7:50 P.M. ( EASTERN).
MUST TALK RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!
I will be re-tweeting some of your better, most imaginative and hopefully insightful tweets.
Make them good (great)!
Important stuff.
Hillary won't call out radical Islam!
She will be soundly defeated.
The podium in the Oval Office looks odd!
Not good, but the words will be the key.
Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd.
Amendment!
Is that all there is?
We need a new President - FAST!
Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL.
Should have gone after the oil years ago (like I have been saying).
Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.
Obama said in his speech that Muslims are our sports heroes.
What sport is he talking about, and who?
Is Obama profiling?
I spoke with other candidates to a Jewish group, many friends, in D.C. I said "I'm a negotiator like you" Got standing O-rated best of day!
N.Y.C. has the worst Mayor in the United States.
I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets, the homeless and crime!
The @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by  @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon.
The @washingtonpost loses   money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!
If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag.
The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!
I am signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA.
Order yours now--makes a great holiday gift!
@washingtonpost is going out of its way to tell failing candidates how to beat Donald Trump.
The Post doesn’t get that I’m good at winning!
I am greatly honored by the results of the CNN poll in Iowa.
In the end, I believe the final results will be even better than that!
I am especially grateful for the tremendous support I have received from the Evangelicals in the just out Iowa CNN poll.
Thank you!
Thank you Iowa!
Just put out a very important policy statement on the extraordinary influx of hatred & danger coming into our country.
We must be vigilant!
On my way to Charleston/Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.
Big crowd.
Look forward to it!
Just released @CNN Poll gives me a big 13 point lead in Iowa.
Change your false story failing @nytimes.
Thank you Iowa!
Great video of tonights crowd reacting to my latest proposal in SC.
Thank you for the support, South Carolina!
Just won IOWA @CNN Poll BIG: Trump 33% Cruz 20% Rubio 11%,  but @WSJ reported "Cruz momentum" but nothing about the fact that I easily won!
I wish the @WSJ Wall Street Journal had reported the just out @CNN Iowa Poll correctly.
I lead by a wide margin,13 points, going up big!
I am signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA.
Order yours now--makes a great holiday gift!
A new poll indicates that 68% of my supporters would vote for me if I departed the GOP & ran as an independent.
A very big poll is coming out at 6 PM in New Hampshire.
Will be very interested in the results.
The legendary @BarbaraJWalters will be asking me questions about the Presidential campaign on @WNTonight at 6:30 PM.
Will be on @ABC News tonight at 6:30.
Interviewed by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters!
Great new poll from NH.
Thank you!
We need to keep this country safe!
Prior to the end of the year, I will be traveling to Israel.
I am very much looking forward to it.
Despite my great respect for King Abdullah II, I will not be visiting Jordan at this time.
This is in response to the false @AP report.
Our country is facing a major threat from radical Islamic terrorism.
We better get very smart, and very tough, FAST, before it is too late!
Wow, what a day.
Great poll numbers just coming out of New Hampshire.
BIG lead for "Trump" according to @CNN!
The failing @nytimes does not mention the new @CNN Poll that has me leading Iowa by a massive 13 points - I am at 33%.
Maggie Haberman, sad!
The last person corrupt Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Donald J. Trump.
I'll end up beating her in every state.
New Fox Poll-Trump!
Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President.
We need strong and super smart for our next leader - or trouble!
I am signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA.
Makes a great holiday gift.
Order yours now!
@Mayor_Nutter of Philadelphia, who is doing a terrible job, should be ashamed for using such a disgusting word in referring to me.
Low life!
Thank you, Piers, they don't know what they're getting into.
Thank you @JebBush- you finally get it!
The police in London say I’m right.
Major article in Daily Mail.
“We can’t wear uniform in our own cars”.
I am interviewed on the  @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00.
Then at 10:00, I am interviewed by @donlemon on @CNN.
Enjoy!
Thank you for all of your support, South Carolina!
@secupp, who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly, is one of the dumber pundits on T.V. Hard to watch, zero talent!
Why does @CNN bore their audience with people like @secupp, a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue.
I hear she will soon be gone!
Great leaders listen to and support law enforcement officials.
Thank you @oreillyfactor for your wonderful editorial as to why I should have been @TIME Magazine's Person of the Year.
You should run Time!
Great interview tonight @donlemon - very professionally done.
Weak and totally conflicted people like @TheRickWilson shouldn't be allowed on television unless given an I.Q. test.
Dumb as a rock!
@Megynkelly spent a big part of her show talking about other shows spending so much time on me.
Really weird, she's being driven crazy!
Wow, my poll numbers have just been announced and have gone through the roof!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends this morning at 7:30.
So much to talk about!
Our VISA system is broken, like so much else in our country.
We better get it fixed really fast.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The United Kingdom is trying hard to disguise their massive  Muslim problem.
Everybody is wise to what is happening, very sad!
Be honest.
I am signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA.
Order yours now--makes a great holiday gift!
Thank you for your support!
Dummy @KarlRove continues to make and write false statements.
He still thinks Romney won--he should get a life!
Establishment flunky @KarlRove is going crazy with the just released CBS poll that has me way ahead.
New Fox poll has me beating Hillary.
An honor to be endorsed by the New England Police Benevolent Association.
Thank you!
Thank you to @Franklin_Graham.
I have always appreciated your courage, but now more so than ever!
In Britain, more Muslims join ISIS than join the British army.
Respected Morning Consult poll just out.
I lead all Republicans and beat Hillary head to head by a wide margin- 45 to 40!
@BernardGoldberg was not good tonight on @oreillyfactor.
He just doesn't know about winning!
But he is a nice guy.
Great evening last night in  New Hampshire.
Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big  territory, great people!
Thank you..
@Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa, which I am leading big in new @CNN poll.
I will win Iowa.
Also, I beat Hillary easily!
Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack.
I am leading by so much he must.
I hope so, he will fall like all others.
Will be easy!
@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!
@Morning_Joe just went off the rails.
I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me..
@chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless.
He knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning!
I fixed his rating problem.
Our spectacular ballroom under construction at the great Turnberry resort in Scotland.
Great news in Georgia!
The just out  Landmark poll shows me in first with 43%!
Wow.
Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process.
I will win!
Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' & PA Governor.
Him & his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!
I will not let you down!
Thank you!
Thank you @SeanHannity & @BoDiet!
Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money.
Can’t do it when I get elected..
@MonicaCrowley you were great with @SeanHannity on @FoxNews tonight.
Thank you for your kind words.
We will keep Americans safe.
I had a great time in Des Moines, Iowa tonight!
Thank you for all of the support.
Just got back from Iowa, great people!
@loudobbsnews did a fantastic interview with syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin.
Congrats to both!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M. So much to talk about!
Thank you!
@Franklin_Graham, so many people have tweeted about your amazing words to me, thank you!
Heading to big crowd in South Carolina!
Getting the support of @DanaWhite of UFC means a lot.
A total winner, who has done an amazing job.
Just ordered his fight to watch tonight!
John Podesta says nominee will be Cruz b/c last person Hillary wants to face is Trump!
Use your head folks!
A great afternoon.
Thank you South Carolina!
Thank you General.
New CNN Iowa poll --- Trump 33, Cruz 20.
Everyone else way down!
Don't trust Des Moines Register poll- biased towards Trump!
I will be on CNN's - State of the Union tomorrow morning at 9amE.
I will be interviewed on @jaketapper @CNN at 9:00 A.M. and Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:O0  A.M. CNN Iowa Poll -13 point lead!
Something must be done with dopey @KarlRove - he is pushing Republicans down the same old path of defeat..
@Peggynoonannyc Interesting article, but I will beat Hillary easily.
People that have given up on the system will come out to vote for me!
@Peggynoonannyc An election between Hillary and myself will be the biggest voter turnout in U.S. history.
Just like the debates 24 M vs 2M..
People that have read it tell me that @KarlRove book is terrible (and boring).
Save your money!
@FoxNews should can him, no credibility!
@danawhite  Great job last night - very exciting!
You have come a long way from those difficult early days, I am proud of you.
A very good NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll was just released wherein I went up from last month and am in the lead.
Nice!
Many think that the Championship Course at Turnberry, home of The Duel In The Sun, will be the worlds best after the renovation.
I did interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews in order to be fair.
He then puts on Rove, Lane and Will, three Trump bashers, to discuss.
I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back, get caught, and then deny it.
Well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics!
People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!
Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others.
Think about it!
Another great accolade for @TrumpGolf.
Highly respected Golf Odyssey- awarded @TrumpDoral Blue Monster with best redesign.
Thank you!
Thank you @WayneAllynRoot.
Very nice!
@PatrickBuchanan was great on @TeamCavuto @FoxNews.
Thank you Pat!
@scottienhughes - you were fantastic on CNN.
Thank you for the nice words.
Can't believe Major League Baseball just rejected @PeteRose_14 for the Hall of Fame.
He's paid the price.
So ridiculous - let him in!
Thank you @hardball_chris for your nice words.
They are very much appreciated.
I fully understand that you really get it.
Thank you @CarlHigbie.
Great work on @CNN.
What an evening in Las Vegas, Nevada!
THANK YOU for your continued support.
Thank you for your support!
Wow, I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost - 38%.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead.
They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place)..
@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead.
She said 15!
@megynkelly is very bad at math.
She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.
I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight.
No matter how well I do - bad!
I am in Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas, getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight.
Look forward -   hope I get treated fairly!
Between Iraq war monger @krauthammer, dummy @KarlRove, deadpan @GeorgezWill, highly overrated @megynkelly, among others, @FoxNews not fair!
I won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @DRUDGE_REPORT, @TIME @Slate and more.
Too bad dopey @megynkelly lies!
@ConradMBlack, what an honor to read your piece.
As one of the truly great intellects & my friend, I won't forget!
New PPP poll just released in Iowa- up 6 points from last poll.
Leading w/ 28%!
Don't worry - media won't report it!
Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA.
Thank you!
We're not talking about religion; we're talking about security.
Thank you, @FrankLuntz - for saying I was a winner tonight.
It is my great honor.
Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night.
All polls agree.
It was fun and interesting!
Thank you @davidaxelrod for your nice words this morning on @CNN.
It was a good night!
@MarkHalperin works so hard but just doesn't have a natural instinct for politics.
Others do, and those are the people you want to follow!
Bill O'Reilly calls Trump and  campaign brilliant.
In first place by 27 points.
Will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. Will be talking about the debate, and more!
Thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland.
The debate was interesting, and fun.
Keep up the great work!
Jeb Bush had a tough night at the debate.
Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money, he is their puppet, and buy ad's.
Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective - no strength, no stamina.
Will be on @jimmykimmel tonight at 11:35pmE on @ABC..
Will be on @jimmykimmel in 20 minutes on @ABC.
Thank you!
New Reuters poll - thank you!
As I have been saying.
Only the beginning: "ISIS Suspects Arrested in Turkey, 150 European Passports Seized"..
@MelindaDC  Don’t misrepresent in order to make a point.
I was always tough on ISIS--as you’ll find out after I get elected.
I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster.
Try using your last name & don’t be ashamed of it!
Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response.
False advertising!
@JebBush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for President.
He should remain true to himself.
The last thing our country needs is another BUSH!
Dumb as a rock!
Thank you for all of your support!
Most importantly - we need to get everyone out to VOTE!
Another new post-debate poll.
THANK YOU!
See, Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed).
Disloyal person!
President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747.
Thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa!
Thank you America!
@FoxNews post-debate poll with +/- from previous poll..
@GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so.
She says that so people believe it - opposite!
Hillary Clinton lied when she said that "ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool"..
@JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today.
Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence.
A basket case!
Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me.
Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night.
SAD!
It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night.
Not very presidential!
@MissUniverse final 3 on now.
Great people, great new owner @IMG.
WATCH.
Great poll out of Illinois!
Thank you!
@JebBush today said he didn't want to be the front-runner, he would rather be where he is now, 2%.
That is the talk of a loser, can't win!
Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant.
I sold it 6 months ago for a record price.
This would never have happened!
Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst".
She made up story-want apology!
I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate.
There never was a video.
Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be".
Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?
MAGA!
Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18,000,000.
CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE - 6,700,000.
And they were on major network vs.
cable!
Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan.
Big crowd tonight.
Make America Great Again!
It's the Democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to ISIS --  not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie!
A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
When will our leaders get tough and smart.
We are being led to slaughter!
Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts.
Big progress is being made.
Keep up the great work!
Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by ISIS.
There is no video.
Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening!
See you there.
THANK YOU Grand Rapids, Michigan!
Time to end political correctness & secure our homeland!
Thank you - New Hampshire!
Thank you - Michigan!
THANK YOU America!
Video from Michigan last night.
After asking for months, the media panned their cameras!
Weak and low energy @JebBush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy..
@JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy.
Will never work!
Will @JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?
Why doesn't @JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?
@JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent.
Women defy media narrative, love Trump at packed Michigan rally.
Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television.
Boring and biased!
Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements.
He is really pathetic!
NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls".
Wow, new Reuters Poll just out.
Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly.
The media knows this.
Often used word in politics!
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong.
Sad!
We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!
Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category.
Likeability way up.
Thank you America!
The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic.
Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.
The silent majority- is silent no more!
Remember the importance of VOTING!
@FoxNews treats me so badly.
Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll.
All negative!
Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime.
He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased.
Still thinks Romney won.
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.
New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories.
Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to.
I have great respect for women.
BE CAREFUL!
Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays!
Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign".
Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing.
He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot).
That's what U.S. needs!
In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll.
Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%.
Stop throwing your money down the drain!
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias.
Think about Bill!
Next year will be an interesting one.
Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS.
It's about time!
Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll?
CNN even better!
@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz.
Be honest Chuck!
I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video.
Bad reporting.
Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!
@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today.
Very wise indeed!
Merry Christmas to all.
Have a great day and have a really amazing year.
Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
It will be done!
@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly.
Have her on more!
Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally.
Politics!
We have many problems in our house (country!
), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE?
He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A.
That will stop, I will fix this quickly!
When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it"?
Never!
@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...
and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings.
I will beat Hillary!
The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.
The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before.
The wait is horrendous, and people are dying.
Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years.
We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country.
MUST CHANGE!
A new terror warning was issued for European cties.
At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart.
Weak leaders!
Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!
Thank you!
I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!
It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters.
BAD!
R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row.
Will now not allow desperately needed new voters.
Suicidal mistake.
RNC MUST ACT NOW!
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory.
The Dems LOVE IT!
Be smart and win for a change!
@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high.
Lie!
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late.
Stupid!
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party.
FAST!
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!
The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years.
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries.
We now are part time, sad!
I WILL FIX!
Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.
We need smart and strong leadership now!
Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster!
Thank you!
Thank you- Nashua, New Hampshire!
Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008.
He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist!
@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews - he really gets it!
My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).
So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place.
Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done.
Run country my way!
Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today.
Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic!
We need a real President!
Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!
The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.
Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical.
THANK YOU Council Bluffs, Iowa!
The silent majority, is silent no more!
@CharlesHurt   You were great on @seanhannity last night.
Thanks for the nice words.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people.
I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina.
The dying @UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!
Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @UnionLeader.
It's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much.
Thank you Hilton Head, South Carolina!
Thank you Hilton Head, South Carolina!
I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016.
Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!
Great poll- thank you Nevada!
A lovely letter from the daughter of the late great John Wayne.
Our country could use a John Wayne right now.
I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper, which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid, will be dead in 2 years!
A GREAT day in South Carolina.
Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm.
This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@JebBush has spent  $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls.
I have spent almost nothing and am at the top.
WIN!
People ask, "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about @JebBush when he is so low in the polls"?
Because of his big $ hit ads on me!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @DonaldJTrumpJr!
Very proud of you!
THANK YOU ILLINOIS!
Let's not forget to get family & friends- out to VOTE IN 2016!
Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails.
They just want it all to end.
BAD!
I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR.
WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!
I will be on @FoxNews live,  with members of my family, at 11:50 P.M.
We will ring in the New Year together!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
HAPPY NEW YEAR & THANK YOU!
Well, the year has officially begun.
I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!
I will be going to Mississippi tomorrow night - hear the crowds are going to be massive!
Look forward to it.
The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me.
It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!
Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night.
Look forward to it!
@JebBush is a sad case.
A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!
@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls.
Has no chance!
Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S.
We must be vigilant!
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president.
Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!
Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party.
I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!
Heading to Biloxi, Mississippi.
Massive crowds expected.
Thank you for your support!
Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally.
Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive.
Will be an amazing evening!
Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.
Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video.
The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.
Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must.
Hillary lied!
Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe.
If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!
Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS!
Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary?
She LOST!
Now Bill is at it again.
Just watch..
@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that "attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before".
Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won!
@RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.
Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil.
THEY JUST FOUND IT!
The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her.
Just watch.
By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the  Al-Shabaab terror video.
I look forward to being in Lowell, Massachusetts, today.
I hear a very big crowd is expected--we will have lots of fun!
Woody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBush’s finance chairman.
If Woody would’ve been w/me, he would’ve been in the playoffs, at least!
The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Wow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10—bad management.
No wonder they begged me for ads.
I don’t know @SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials—boring.
Not a fan.
I am in New Hampshire.
Just received great news from Reuters poll.
Thank you for your support!
Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country.
New Years Eve was a disaster.
THINK!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump!
Very proud of you!
I don’t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheats—with his game he has no choice—and stop doing commercials!
Don’t like @SamuelLJackson’s golf swing.
Not athletic.
I’ve won many club championships.
Play him for charity!
Huge crowd expected tomorrow night!
VT Police say first come, first serve.
Arrive early!
I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today.
Please join us 5PM ET.
Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads?
The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads.
How stupid, how desperate!
@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%.
Very disloyal company.
Another win for Trump!
Boycott.
It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago.
Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!
I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally.
Will be great fun.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Man shot inside Paris police station.
Just announced that terror threat is at highest level.
Germany is a total mess-big crime.
GET SMART!
Massive crowd in VT tonight.
Venue not big enough.
Officials say NO to outside event and sound system.
Arrive early!
@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue.
Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win!
I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster.
Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!
Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response.
False advertising!
Hillary and her friends!
The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall.
Whoopi Goldberg is terrible.
Very sad!
Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView.
We love Barbara!
I'm leaving now for Burlington, Vermont.
It will be wild!
We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in.
The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable!
Great time in Burlington, Vermont.
Crowd was amazing.
Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago.
He is not happy, a total waste of money!
On my way to South Carolina.
Big Crowd--- look forward to it!
I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump.
Nobody knows jobs like I do!
Don’t let them sell you out!
Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump.
I will create jobs like no one else.
Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon.
Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd!
Will be wild.
Great even in SC tonight!
Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away.
Thank you for coming!
Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time!
South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun).
I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses.
Love it!
Thank you, @TheFix- Chris Cillizza.
It is a true person of character that can change his opinion & do what is right..
@JonahNRO, watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- I have been waiting for them for a long time.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Earnest must have been a great person.
(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week.
David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.
(2/2) David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal!
Read it!
I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate.
Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning.
Tune in!
Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning.
Enjoy!
I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day.
The crowds were amazing.
Will be back Tuesday!
Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds.
They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!
In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet.
On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally.
Good poll numberd all over!
Remember, get TIME magazine!
I am on the cover.
Take it out in 4 years and read it again!
Just watch...
I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate.
If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates.
I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows.
They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog.
For starters, try getting a new publisher!
Thank you to our law enforcement officers!
Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime?
@ABC can do much better than him!
Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich.
I am sending out for your book immediately.
Thank you very much!
So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate.
Paper won't survive, highly unethical!
Just arrived in New Hampshire.
Thank you to all of my supporters!
Congratulations to @jdickerson of Face the Nation on his highest ratings in 15 years.
Thank you!
@RinglingBros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same.
New Iowa poll.
Thank you!
@megynkelly recently said that she can’t be wooed by Trump.
She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!
Will be on @FallonTonight with @JimmyFallon on @NBC at 11:35pmE.
Enjoy!
Thank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated!
@MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately.
Total agenda, bad reporter!
Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years.
Congratulations and WOW!
Don't forget to watch The Tonight Show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 11:30 P.M. You will not be disappointed!
Fantastic job on @CNN  tonight.
@kayleighmcenany is a winner!
@stuartpstevens horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility.
Don't blame Mitt!
Now Stevens can't get a job!
The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes.
Enjoy!
THANK YOU!
On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now.
Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!
Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP.
Great doubt, Dems will sue!
Let's all work together to solve this problem.
Another new Iowa poll just released.
Thank you!
New CBS poll.
The Iran deal is terrible.
Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia.
Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me.
Not nice, but OK!
New polls are great.
The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time.
New leadership fast!
Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton.
In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!
Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars.
Don't release money.
We want our hostages back NOW!
Thank you for your support last night, Iowa!
Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility.
Dems will sue!
My nomination would increase voter turnout.
Thank you!
THANK YOU, IOWA!
Highly respected @OANN @GravisMarketing poll just released.
THANK YOU!
Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors.
Horrible pictures & images.
We are weak.
I will NOT forget!
Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches.
Romney campaign,his book,etc.
Why does @andersoncooper put him on?
United States looks more and more like a paper tiger.
Won't be that way if I win!
Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors?
Our country was humiliated.
WSJ/NBC Poll: Donald Trump Widens His Lead in Republican Presidential Race.
Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement.
Sen.
Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush..
@GeraldoRivera  Thank you Geraldo for your nice words on @oreillyfactor tonight.
You are a true champion!
Thank @ericbolling - great guy!
Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people.
Will be back soon!
@oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that I supported John McCain big league in 2008, not Obama!
@FrankLuntz is a total clown.
Has zero credibility!
More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends!
Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart.
No more being politically correct.
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago.
Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow.
Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen.
He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file.
Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand.
Not much of a reformer!
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace.
Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi.
Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks.
They own him!
Great new numbers.
Thank you!
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite.
Says one thing for money, does another for votes.
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm!
Thank you!
Wow!
Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int.
loan from Goldman Sachs.
Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning?
Interesting read from Peggy Noonan.
In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners.
They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list.
This will create great incentive for others!
Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...
but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus!
Big announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday!
You will not want to miss this rally!
Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday.
Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore!
I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.
Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses.
Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words.
I am very proud of the role model you are for so many.
Leaving for Liberty University.
I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd.
A great morning with everyone @LibertyU!
Thank you!
Off to New Hampshire now.
I loved being at Liberty University today!
Record setting crowd, unbelievable people!
Thank you Jerry and Becki!
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls.
He is nervous.
People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem.
Doubt!
@TheBrodyFile great job on @AC360.
Thank you for the very smart and kind words!
Wow, new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!
Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people, including Karl Rove, losers-true!
I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- he’s a winner!
Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.
On my way to Iowa- just received new national poll numbers.
Thank you!
@FreeJesseJames- Just read your complete statement.
You are an amazing guy & I really appreciate your words & support.
I will see you soon!
Thank you Georgia!
I appreciate all of your support.
Thank you for your strong testimony when welcoming me to Liberty University, yesterday- @JerryJrFalwell.
In the just released SC poll I increased my lead by 4 points since last poll by same firm.
Up by 14!
Cruz dropped 3.
A true honor to receive the endorsement of John Wayne's daughter....
Wow, the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that "Ted Cruz must be defeated".
Big shoker!
People do not like Ted.
I am greatly honored to receive Sarah Palin's endorsement tonight.
Great rally in Iowa!
Such wonderful people.
Traveling now with @SarahPalinUSA to Tulsa- massive crowd expected!
Had to turn away 5k, but we are coming back soon to take care of them!
So much love in the crowd!
Thanks!
Thank you, Florida!
Thank you, New Hampshire!
New CNN/WMUR New Hampshire poll just released.
Thank you!
Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted.
Glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul!
So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma.
Dishonest reporting!
Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL.
But he can't beat me.
Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign.
Millions spent on me.
He should go home and relax!
New Day on CNN treats me very badly.
@AlisynCamerota is a disaster.
Not going to watch anymore.
Happy birthday to my friend, the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!
Thank you, Iowa!
Thank you!
Thank you, New Hampshire!
Why does @Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy, John Sununu on- spewing false info?
I will beat Hillary by a lot, she wants no part of Trump.
Thank you, Iowa!
National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way.
It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low.
Sad!
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead.
The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review!
Ted Cruz complains about my views on eminent domain, but without it we wouldn't have roads, highways, airports, schools or even pipelines.
Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated, "Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President".
After spending $89 million, @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls.
He is ashamed to use the name "Bush" in ads.
Low energy guy!
Wow!
The dying @NRO National Review has totally given up the fight against Barrack Obama.
They have been losing for years.
I will beat Hillary!
New Reuters poll!
Thank you!
Leaving Nevada now for Iowa.
Things are looking good - great new polls!
Wow!
New National Zogby Poll just out:.
TRUMP 45.
CRUZ 13.
RUBIO 8.
Big numbers.
Just received the new Fox poll.
Thank you, America!
The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all.
Really dishonest reporting.
Rush Limbaugh is great, tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy!
Thanks Rush!
Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on?
Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him.
Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin..
@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog.
Why doesn't he say that?
The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times.
Very few listeners - sad!
Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose.
Puppet!
Is Cruz honest?
He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans.
No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.
A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it.
I am for the people and the people are for me.
I am in Iowa.
Will be making two speeches today.
Good luck to all of the great folks on the East coast.
Enjoy the beauty of the storm!
I will be the greatest job-producing president in American history..
@AnnCoulter has been amazing.
We will win and establish strong borders, we will build a WALL and Mexico will pay.
We will be great again!
I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T.V. ads by the other candidates.
All bull, politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!
Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big.
Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run!
Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing.
Dr. Robert Jeffress will make the introduction.
Make America Great Again!
Based on @MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.
Failing @GlennBeck lost all credibility.
Not only was he fired @ FOX, he would have voted for Clinton over McCain.
A wonderful story on Iowa voters by @arappeport of the @NYTimes.
Just left Sioux Center, Iowa.
My speech was very well received.
Truly great people!
Packed house- overflow!
Heading now to Pella, Iowa.
Big crowd!
Remember, Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows.
See you soon!
@williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement.
You are a fantastic guy!
It will not be forgotten.
Don and Eric say hello!
I will be on FOX with the great @JudgeJeanine tonight at 9pm EST!
Enjoy!
Just left a great event in Pella.
Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine, Iowa.
Serious doubt in Illinois as to whether or not Cruz can run for President.
First of many challenges.
Word is that crying @GlennBeck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary.
Dumb as a rock.
Love making correct predictions.
National Review is over.
I will be on @meetthepress this morning at various times across the U.S. @NBCNews  Enjoy!
I will be on Face The Nation this morning at various times across the U.S. @CBSNews  Enjoy!
I will make our Military so big, powerful & strong that no one will mess with us.
New Fox News Poll Thank you, Iowa!
Fox News Poll Thank you, New Hampshire!
IPSOS/REUTERS POLL Thank you!
I want to win for the people of this great country.
The only people I will owe are the voters.
Join us in Iowa, tomorrow!
Obama's deal vs.
I will be on Morning's with Maria on the Fox Business Network tomorrow during the 7am and 8am ET hours.
I will be on @CNNSitRoom with @wolfblitzer from 5-7pm est.
on @CNN.
Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck.
He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth!
Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock.
Lies never work!
Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's.
These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!
Leaving now for New Hampshire.
Big crowd- looking forward to it!
Just landed in New Hampshire.
Will be at the venue shortly.
Thank you - Farmington, New Hampshire!
I will be doing @GMA @GStephanopoulos this morning at around 7:00.
Likewise, I will be doing @Morning_Joe at around 7:00.
Figure it out!
I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria  @FoxBusiness at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy.
I will end common core.
It's a disaster.
Great honor- Rev.
Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation, has just endorsed me!
@bobvanderplaats begged me to do an event while asking organizers for $100,000 for himself—a bad guy!
Do you think @SenTedCruz knows about @bobvanderplaats dealings?
Actually, I doubt it!
THANK YOU!
Thank you, America!
I refuse to call Megyn Kelly a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct.
Instead I will only call her a lightweight reporter!
The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism.
Just got to listen to Rush Limbaugh - the guy is fantastic!
Even though I beat him in the first six debates, especially the last one, Ted Cruz wants to debate me again.
Can we do it in Canada?
I am self funding my campaign so I do not owe anything to lobbyists & special interests.
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00 P.M. (Eastern).
Enjoy!
It was the childishly written & taunting PR statement by Fox that made me not do the debate, more so than lightweight reporter, @megynkelly.
Thank you- Lexington, South Carolina!
FOX debate advertising rates falling like a rock!
Tune into my special event for the Veterans at 9pm EST!
On Greta, 87% of the people said they would not watch the debate if I'm not in it.
Wow- what an honor!
Wow, two candidates called last night and said they want to go to my event tonight at Drake University.
The "debate" tonight will be a total disaster - low ratings with advertisers and advertising rates dropping like a rock.
I hate to see this.
Being politically correct takes too much time.
We have too much to get done!
It is my great honor to support our Veterans with you!
You can join me now.
Thank you!
I hear that @SenTedCruz’s $$ man, Robert Mercer, a good man, is very angry because Cruz lied to him about liquidating his (Ted’s) holdings.?
Watching biased Charles @krauthammer, a @FoxNews flunky who didn't know that I won every debate, in particular- the last one.
Check polls!
An unbelievable night in Iowa with our great Veterans!
We raised $6,000,000.00 while the politicians talked!
I will take care of the Veterans who have served this country so bravely.
Thank you for the kind words tonight, @OMAROSA.
You were great!
See you soon!
Thank you, America!
Thank you for your support!
Good morning America!
Thank you for all of your support in the latest Drudge poll!
Iowa was amazing last night.
The event could not have worked out better.
We raised $6,000,000 for our great vets.
Getting ready to take off for Nashua, New Hampshire.
Big crowd, will be there soon.
Fun!
Great Twitter poll- and I wasn't even there.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Mitchell FOX2 Michigan Poll finds Trump holds 3-1 lead over closest GOP opponents.
Thank you- Nashua, New Hampshire!
Join me tomorrow in Dubuque, Iowa!
Thank you, America!
They say that if I participated in last night’s Fox debate, they would have had 12 million more & would have broken the all time record.
Thank you for all of your support Iowa!
The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton.
At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?
The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator.
Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective.
Wants paid for pols..
@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator.
How the hell did he ever get elected?
Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him.
Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!
@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night.
$6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS..
@oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS!
Looking forward to a great weekend in Iowa!
THANK YOU to all of the incredible volunteers, behind the scenes in Iowa!
Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk.
Not presidential material!
I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning.
Finally, after all these years of watching stupidity, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I want to thank evangelical Christians for the warm embrace I've received on the campaign trail.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation".
They are now under investigation.
Bad!
@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy.
Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more).
I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event.
The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself..
@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man.
When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz.
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania.
After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada).
Will loose big to Hillary.
Polls show I beat Hillary easily!
WIN!
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form.
Very low interest loans, scam!
Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels.
There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace.
He lies!
By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.
If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved).
Also, VETS got $6,000,000.
I am in Iowa.
Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning.
ENJOY!
I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning.
Enjoy!
It is time to take back our country- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
So nice to get an endorsement from the founder and owner of Pizza Ranch in Iowa!
A great guy and great places!
Join us!
It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
My experience in Iowa was a great one.
I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place.
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio.
Came in a strong second.
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly.
Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire.
I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one.
I will keep doing, but not worth it!
Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment!
On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!
Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job.
We said no and she went hostile.
A real dummy!
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it.
That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated.
Bad!
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud.
Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz.
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote.
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies".
Thank you New Hampshire!
Stop the assault on American values.
THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock, Arkansas tonight!
A record crowd of 12K.
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me.
He would be so easy to beat!
Thank you @billoreilly & @KarlRove.
Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch..
@oreillyfactor @KarlRove- as per the show, an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone.
This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone, a misdemeanor at minimum.
Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment.
I won’t let them take away our guns!
Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire, boarding now.
Amazing activity planned.
New UMASS poll, very nice!
I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire.
Should be very interesting!
Watch @AC360 on NOW!
Join us Monday, February 8th @ the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire!
Big storm in New Hampshire.
Moved my event to Monday.
Will be there next four days.
Live Free or Die: A motto for the whole country to follow.
I very much look forward to tomorrow’s debate in New Hampshire—so many things to say, so much at stake.
It will be an incredible evening!
Such great support in New Hampshire.
Heading to South Carolina, really big crowd!
Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow.
Join me at Clemson University on Wednesday, February 10th!
Really dumb @CheriJacobus.
Begged my people for a job.
Turned her down twice and she went hostile.
Major loser, zero credibility!
Will be in New Hampshire tomorrow- love it.
I told you so.
Our country totally lost control of illegal immigration, even with criminals.
It never ends!
I said this was happening long ago- I will stop this immediately!
Wow, Jeb Bush, whose campaign is a total disaster, had to bring in mommy to take a slap at me.
Not nice!
The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop.
If elected POTUS- I will create borders & the drugs will stop pouring in.
Join me tomorrow in Plymouth, New Hampshire!
I love New Hampshire - will be an exciting evening!
Come join us at the Verizon Wireless Center- Manchester, New Hampshire on 2/8!
I will be on State of the Union @CNN with @jaketapper at 9am.
Enjoy!
I am on @foxandfriends now!
Tune in!
I will be on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd on NBC this morning.
Enjoy!
Great to meet everyone while having breakfast @ChezVachon this morning!
We are going to have a big event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire!
Thank you Newt!
Thank you- Plymouth, New Hampshire!
I am in New Hampshire having a great time!
So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
My two wonderful sons, Don and Eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now!
Enjoy.
Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad.
He is a weak candidate!
Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem, New Hampshire.
Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack.
A pathetic figure!
America needs strong leadership.
Politicians can talk but they don’t get things done.
Today's third stop- Londonderry, New Hampshire!
Thank you!
Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs.
Sad!
Thank you, New Hampshire!
Thank you, New Hampshire!
Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love").
Not a leader!
I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot.
His family used private eminent domain!
No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me.
I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION.
States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me.
Great!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40.
A.M. Enjoy!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you for a great night at the Verizon Wireless Arena- New Hampshire!
A message to the great people of New Hampshire on this important day!
New Hampshire vote today -  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me.
We will save $'s and have much better healthcare!
We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border.
We will build a WALL and have security.
Thank you, New Hampshire!
Departing with my amazing family now!
Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire, I love you!
Now, off to South Carolina.
Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex.
Paper will close soon!
Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer!
Liabilities are massive!
Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business.
Bad reporting- no money, no cred!
Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people!
Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.
So funny, Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!
Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!
I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.
THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina!
I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core.
Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!
There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking.
It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st.
Big difference in capability!
@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word.
I never said the word, left an open blank.
Please apologize!
Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM!
He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Jeb failed as Jeb!
He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq).
Spent $120 million.
Weak-no chance!
We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me.
We are watching!
Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech.
Expecting a very large crowd!
See you soon.
Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson.
How can he preach Christian values?
Just landed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in.
Wow!
THANK YOU- Baton Rouge, Louisiana!
Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech.
Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?
Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage".
Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest.
Perhaps all 3?
How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?
NEVADA!
Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.
The failing @NYDailyNews, destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online.
It's dead!
You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary.
Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get.
After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.
Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC.
False advertising- desperate and sad!
If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself.
If he doesn't do better this time, he is out!
I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders!
We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!
Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments!
Another 5,000 outside.
Will be back!
When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit?
Will happen soon.
Word is that little Morty Zuckerman’s @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible?
Just got back from Tampa.
It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people!
Will be in South Carolina tomorrow.
I am the only one who can fix this.
Very sad.
Will not happen under my watch!
Now an additional 600-700 jobs in America (2,000) being eliminated for move to Mexico- via Hartford Courant.
The RNC, which is probably not on my side, just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.
Totally unauthorized, do not pay.
I am self funding my campaign!
Notice has just been withdrawn.
A very big thank you to Bill Donohue, head of The Catholic League, for the wonderful interview on @CNN and article in Newsmax!
Thank you, South Carolina!
We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!
Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.
The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY!
Wow!
Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention.
I hope you are right - I will make you proud!
Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot & I hold liberal positions.
LIES!
Ted Cruz is a cheater!
He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!
Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!
Thank you!
I miss my father.
All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc.
Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty.
He has zero cred- totally dishonest!
Hey @glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll?
Your endorsement means nothing!
Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc.
, has me winning the debate by a lot, @FoxNews only puts negative people on.
Biased - a total joke!
This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts.
Really?
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning.
Enjoy!
Thank you for your support!
TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution.
Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!
Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties!
Thank you!
Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court.
Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!
Funny that Jeb(!
) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.
Then mommy, now brother!
Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them.
I will be in South Carolina all week.
Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG!
Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!
), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse?
Careful!
I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me!
Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process.
JEB is a hypocrite!
Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!
Thank you for your continued support!
What a night!
THANK YOU!
VOTE on Saturday!
New South Carolina poll from PPP.
Thank you!
Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina.
Great people and spirit.
Today will be more of the same.
New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big, Cruz, Rubio and Bush down.
The debate results, even with a stacked RNC audience, were wonderful!
Thank you!
Just sat down for a great interview with @PHussionWYFF in Greenville today.
Watch at 5pm.
An amazing day in South Carolina!
Thank you to the 2,500+ in North Augusta, South Carolina.
Lines down the block!
Don't forget to VOTE on Saturday!
Thank you, South Carolina!
Will be interviewed by @StephenAtHome tonight by phone- a late show first @CBS @colbertlateshow.
Enjoy!
Explain to @brithume and @megynkelly, who know nothing, that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can!
@brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up ALL of that vote.
The fact is I will get much of it!
Thank you  @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style!
We are doing really well in South Carolina.
Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative?
Without me her ratings would tank.
Get a life Megyn!
Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!
@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.
I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred!
Why does FOX put him on?
@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting.
They do not want Trump to win.
All negative!
Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home.
Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses.
He wants to look cool, but it's far too late.
Thank you Nevada!
THANK YOU AMERICA!
Join us tomorrow in Kiawah, South Carolina!
Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll.
The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie.
I love being in South Carolina.
We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump.
The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke.
No wonder WSJ is doing so badly!
Thank you America!
Thank you South Carolina!
Together, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@FoxNews is changing their  theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced".
But dying @WSJ is worse.
Their phony poll is a  joke!
I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar!
Join us tomorrow night in Charleston, South Carolina!
Join us Saturday night- for the South Carolina Primary Watch Party!
We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!
Tonight I will be on @FoxNews with @SeanHannity at 10pm and @CNN w/ @AndersonCooper at 10:10pm.
Enjoy!
Thank you South Carolina!
Everyone get out and vote tomorrow!
A message from @IvankaTrump!
I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions.
I will eliminate the law, in its entirety, & replace it w/ something much better.
I will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, & allow purchasing across state lines.
Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.
I’m self-funding and I am going to take care of the people – not the special interests and insurance companies like the other candidates.
I use both iPhone & Samsung.
If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info.
Hopefully others will follow suit.
Our country needs & should demand security.
It is time to get tough & be smart!
Just finished two major speeches in South Carolina.
Big crowds, great people.
Going for a third now!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I am the only candidate (in many years) who is self-funding his campaign.
Lobbyists and $ interests totally control all other candidates!
I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque?
Very sad that he did not go!
Remember that Marco Rubio is very weak on illegal immigration.
South Carolina needs strength as illegals and Syrians pour in.
South Carolina voters have the future of our country in their hands.
Vote now (today), and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
People (pundits) gave me no chance in South Carolina.
Now it looks like a possible win.
I would be happy with a one vote victory!
What a great night.
Thank you South Carolina, a special place with truly amazing people!
Thank you @SarahPalinUSA for your amazing help and support.
Big win, leaving now for Atlanta and Nevada.
The people of South Carolina got it!
I will be live on all of the major morning talk shows.
Enjoy!
The failing @WSJ Wall Street Journal should fire both its pollster and its Editorial Board.
Seldom has a paper been so wrong.
Totally biased!
A quote was read from a parody account last night on MSNBC re: Jeb.
Thank you South Carolina!
THANK YOU Atlanta, Georgia!
Leaving for Nevada now.
Lets MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
A number of months ago, I was not expected to win South Carolina,Ted Cruz was, and yet I won in a landslide - every group and category.
WIN!
I am in Las Vegas, at the best hotel (by far), Trump International.
I will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to WIN Nevada!
The reason that Ted Cruz lost the Evangelicals in S.C. is because he is a world class LIAR, and Evangelicals do not like liars!
I hear the Rickets family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me.
They better be careful, they have a lot to hide!
Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate.
I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!
Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr!
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.
Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director.
More dirty tricks!
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact.
Take ad down Ted.
Biggest liar in politics!
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks.
No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks.
He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa.
Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen!
Sad.
I will be on @seanhannity tonight- from Las Vegas, Nevada at 10pmE.
Enjoy!
Thank you Illinois!
Great news!
Just watched the very incompetent Mitt Romney Campaign Strategist, Stuart Stevens.
Now I know why Mitt lost so badly.
Stevens is a clown!
WOW!
Thank you Massachusetts!
See you soon.
Great poll!
Thank you North Carolina!
Thank you Michigan!
Thank you Vermont!
A big fat hit job on @oreillyfactor tonight.
A total waste of time to watch, boring and biased.
@brithume said I would never run, a dope!
Ted Cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens.
Another lie-crazy!
Join me live- now in Las Vegas, Nevada!
We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!
THANK YOU LAS VEGAS, NEVADA!
Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C.
He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication.
He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog!
Ted panicked.
Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President.
Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm.
BAD!
Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again!
The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!
I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up!
Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past.
Join us in Sparks, Nevada today!
Unlike the other Republican candidates, I will be in Nevada all day and night - I won't be fleeing, in and out.
I love & invest in Nevada!
Wow, great Ohio poll.
Shows me leading by 5 points, beating K!
Great.
Just reported on @FoxNews that many people who supported @JebBush are now supporting me.
I knew that would happen, pundits didn't!
Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars.
I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.
Thank you Sparks, Nevada!
My wife Melania will be on @Morning_Joe  tomorrow morning at 8:00.
Interviewed by @morningmika - Enjoy!
GO VOTE FROM NOW TO 8:30 P.M. NEVADA.
I WILL BE AT VARIOUS CAUCUS SITES.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Exclusive interview w/ my wife @MELANIATRUMP- tomorrow morning @ 8amE on @Morning_Joe w/ @morningmika @MSNBC.
Enjoy!
Make sure you get on the Trump line and are not mislead by the Cruz people.
They are bad!
BE CAREFUL.
THANK YOU NEVADA!
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!
THANK YOU NEVADA!
Melania will be interviewed by @morningmika on @Morning_Joe now (8:30 A.M.).
ENJOY!
Big defeat last night in Nevada for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.
@KarlRove on @FoxNews is working hard to belittle my victory.
Rove is sick!
@USATODAY Poll and @QuinnipiacPoll say that I beat both Hillary and Bernie, and I havn't even started on them yet!
I am self funding my campaign & don't owe anybody anything!
I only owe it to the American people!
I am in Virginia @RegentU Presidential forum with Dr. Pat Robertson- beginning now!
In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove.
He should be fired!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters.
That is how I got to 46%.
When others drop out, I will pick up more.
When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win!
When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem!
@RepChrisCollins  Chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement.
I will not let you down!
Texas, Georgia & many more VOTE EARLY!
This is a movement!
Ted Cruz is lying again.
Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head.
Great new poll.
Thank you Texas!
Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns.
Dope!
Why doesn’t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already.
Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway.
Too late now!
Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth.
I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC.
They are great!
Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous?
LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I'm going to do what @MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN!
Join me in Oklahoma tomorrow night!
Thank you Illinois!
Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina, it's over.
He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide!
FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall.
He must apologize!
If I did that there would be a uproar!
THANK YOU!
Failed presidential candidate @MittRomney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12.
Thank you!
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you!
All the online polls have me winning the debate.
I really enjoyed the evening.
Not easy, but good.
Big day in Texas tomorrow!
Having a rally in Fort Worth.
Tremendous crowd.
Will be exciting!
I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas.
Really big crowd expected.
Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!
Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday.
Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done.
Loser!
Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early!
Big announcement to be made!
Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement.
They failed!
Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage.
Not presidential material!
Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night.
Great honor!
Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night.
The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker!
Mr. Meltdown.
They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high & dry.
Doesn't even show up for votes!
Thank you for your support &  friendship- Governor @ChrisChristie!
Never let them see you sweat!
Thank you Texas!
What I would do on my first day in office.
Thank you Pastor Robert Jeffress!
I will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Will be talking about lightweight Marco Rubio and lying Ted Cruz!
I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year.
I have rich friends who never get audited.
I wonder why?
Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit.
After the audit, no problem!
I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!
Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!
I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says.
He didn't - total fabrication!
I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World.
Amazing!
Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record.
It was an honor to be the Grand Marshall- in the Salute to Israel Parade back in 2004.
Incredibly proud of my son @EricTrump & his efforts on behalf of @StJude in Memphis, TN.
THANK YOU Arkansas!
We need to fix our broken education system!
The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.
While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins, Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.
I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover).
I will also get states that no other Republican can get.
Making a big speech in Alabama today.
So many people we had to move to a football stadium!
Come and join us!
Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers.
WATCH!
Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them.
He is another all talk, no action pol!
As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow.
Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R!
A bad messenger for estab!
Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician.
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida.
The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic!
Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action.
Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of "sex offenses".
DISGRACE!
Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers "like absolute trash" in order to pass Obama's amnesty.
I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama!
Landing now!
Our law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation for the incredible job they do.
THANK YOU ALABAMA!
Get out & VOTE on Tuesday!
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you @SenatorSessions!
My sons, Don and Eric, are on @foxandfriends now 7:35.
Great kids, enjoy!
Thank you America!
Get out & VOTE tomorrow!
Join me in Columbus, Ohio tomorrow!
I am self funding my campaign and only work for YOU, the American people!
Governor Alejandro García Padilla said presidential hopeful Sen.
Marco Rubio “is no friend of Puerto Rico".
My wife @MELANIATRUMP will be joining @andersoncooper @AC360 tonight at 8pmE on @CNN.
Enjoy!
Thank you Virginia!
Trump University has a 98% approval rating.
I could have settled but won't out of principle!
Phony Rubio commercial.
I could have settled, but won't out of principle!
See student surveys.
Thank you Brian France, Bill Elliott, @chaseelliott, @DavidRagan, & @RyanJNewman!
Great news- Former Mayor of Dallas, Tom Leppert, has just endorsed me!
Thank you!
Tomorrow is a big day- VOTE!
Thank you Georgia!
Got the endorsement of Brian France and @NASCAR yesterday in Georgia.
Also, many of the sports great drivers.
Thank you Nascar and Georgia!
The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!
Thank you Columbus, Ohio!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Lets go America!
Wow!
Thank you Louisville, Kentucky!
Thank you Georgia!
Thank you Massachusetts!
Thank you Tennessee!
Thank you Alabama!
Thank you Virginia!
Thank you Arkansas!
Thank you Vermont!
The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T.V. ads on me.
Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio.
Check out his credit card scam, his house sale & his no show voting!
Marco Rubio lost big last night.
I even beat him in Virginia, where he spent so much time and money.
Now his bosses are desperate and angry!
Why can't the leaders of the Republican Party see that I am bringing in new voters by the millions-we are creating a larger, stronger party!
@CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump.
Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty.
Love it!
I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare!
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me.
Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama.
I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify.
Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record.
If they are not careful, they will all leave.
Sad!
Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz.
Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected.
Not a good messenger!
Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win!
I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down.
Establishment wants to kill this movement!
Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record.
Marco Rubio is a joke!
I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton.
I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win.
Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago?
The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court.
Go to Trump Doral in Miami and watch the World Golf Championship!
On NOW!
On my way to see the great people of Maine.
Will be landing in Portland in 2 hours.
Look forward to it!
THANK YOU PORTLAND, Maine!
Senator Sessions will serve as the  Chairman of my National Security  Advisory Committee.
Rubio puts out ad that my pilot was a drug dealer- not true, not my pilot!
Guy owned helicopter company- don't think I ever even used.
The Better Business Bureau report, with an A rating for Trump University.
Thank you America!
Thank you Macomb County, Michigan!
U.S. Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.
Thank you Cadillac, Michigan!
Join me in Wichita, Kansas tomorrow morning!
Looking forward to it!
Thank you New Orleans, Louisiana!
Join me in Wichita, Kansas tomorrow morning!
Looking forward to it!
I am in Kansas.
Will be an exciting day.
Big speech this morning in Wichita, and then go to caucus.
Sorry CPAC (the format was fine!
).
Great time last night in Louisiana.
Big and energetic crowd.
Go out and vote now, polls open.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
For all of today's voters please remember that I am the only candidate that is self funding my campaign, I am not bought and paid for!
Wow, big lines in Kansas.
Will be in Orlando, Florida, this afternoon.
This is a movement like our GREAT COUNTRY has never seen before!
Why would anyone in Kentucky listen to failed presidential candidate Rand Paul re: caucus.
Made a fool of himself (1%.
) KY his 2nd choice!
To the people of Kentucky,  Rand Paul didn't want you.
Now he runs back due to his presidential failure.
Thank you Kansas!
Thousands of people inside- and thousands outside who couldn't get into the hall.
Really amazing!
Thank you, Kansas!
The line going into the Orlando event is over a mile long.
Massive crowd expected.
Leaving Kansas now, be there soon!
@MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked!
Romney is a total joke, and everyone knows it!
Romney's failed advisors, like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win.
But they lost- don't know how to win!
Thank you Willie Robertson!
I will be at the Cadillac World Golf Championship @TrumpDoral in Miami tomorrow!
Rory, Phil, Bubba, Adam, and Dustin all at the top!
Thank you Louisiana!
Thank you Kentucky!
@FoxNews is devastated that lightweight Senator Marco Rubio got trounced tonight and is the big loser.
I won the two big states, great!
I will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation this morning.
Enjoy!
Thank you Michigan!
David Brooks, of the New York Times, is closing in on being the dumbest of them all.
He doesn’t have a clue.
Nancy Reagan, the wife of a truly great President, was an amazing woman.
She will be missed!
The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case.
Disgraceful!
Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning.
I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U.S. Rory and Adam Scott are doing great!
Watch on NBC at 3:00 P.M.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false.
Dishonest media!
How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians?
I will be using Facebook & Twitter.
Watch!
Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me.
I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out.
Now nasty!
Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney.
These nasty, angry, jealous  failures have ZERO credibility!
We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads!
I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio.
Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament.
Amazing finish!
Leaving for North Carolina.
Big crowd, will be fun!
Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment.
Dishonest people!
It was great being in Michigan.
Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry!
Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ.
students in FL.
attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews.
Thank you Idaho!
I love your potatoes-  nobody grows them better.
As  President, I will protect your market.
I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm EST on @FoxNews!
Enjoy!
Cruz came to Mississippi, there was nobody there, he left the state.
I had a rally in Madison, MS with 10,000!
Thank you!
I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu.
I’ll be there very soon.
Vote for me, Hawaii!
People forget, it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million.
I said no & they went negative.
Extortion!
The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group.
They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America.
Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho & Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today!
Thank you @EricTrump!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president.
HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE!
Remember, I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign.
All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests!
Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it.
Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit!
Why are they now spokesmen against me?
Sad!
I hear @NBCNews / @WSJ came out with another one of their phony polls.
Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi!
Wow, and with all that money spent against me!
Will be going to Trump Jupiter now!
Thank you America!
Thank you!
Thank you Mississippi!
Thank you Michigan!
This was a great evening- I would like to thank everyone for their wonderful support.
Thank you Hawaii!
Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars, & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me.
They are total losers!
Keep lightweight Marco and his friends out of the White House.
Wow, you are all correct about @FoxNews - totally biased and disgusting reporting.
Thank you Mark.
Thank you America!
Thank you!
Dr. Ben Carson- I concur.
"I believe in God who can change people- he can make any of us better".
Rumor has it that @politico is going out of business.
Losing too much money.
Great news!
Thank you St. Louis, Missouri!
It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly.
A truly great woman & conservative.
Great news!
Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres!
I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam!
Thank you for your support!
The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!
Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered.
Kasich is good for Mexico!
Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust!
Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud!
The rally in Cincinnati is ON.
Media put out false reports that it was cancelled.
Will be great - love you Ohio!
On my way to Dayton, Ohio.
Will be there soon!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you Dayton, Ohio!
The rally in Cincinnati is ON.
Media put out false reports that it was cancelled!
Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest.
Little Marco, his State Chairman, & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote.
We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.
No way to run a country!
The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact!
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people.
Phony politicians!
Just finished my second speech.
Thanks- I love you, Ohio!
Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core!
USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage.
He has ties to ISIS.
Should be in jail!
Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures.
Big problem!
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events.
Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!
Ohio Gov.
Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered.
Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse.
Ohio steel and coal dying!
Gov.
Thank you Kevin.
With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive!
Carly Fiorina- I agree!
Ted Cruz is just another politician.
All talk- no action!
Because Gov.
Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue.
The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers.
They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check.
Really bad people!
Just received from @PeteRose_14.
Thank you Pete!
We don't have a country- if we don't have borders.
Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon.
Wonderful crowds.
Thank you, Florida!
Leaving the great people of North Carolina.
Amazing event.
Heading to Tampa now!
Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!
Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio.
I will bring them back!
THANK YOU - Youngstown, Ohio!
I love you!
Sadly, this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan.
There is nothing nice about it!
Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved.
Vote Trump and end this madness!
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years.
He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign.
Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.
).
Good morning Ohio!
Some additional information from my daughter, @IvankaTrump!
Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72.8% of the vote!
Thank you!
North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000.
Going to Mexico etc.
NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK!
Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy.
Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others).
Kasich is weak on illegal immigration.
We need strong borders now!
In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22.
So why would he be a good candidate?
Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving.
Nobody else can do it.
Our economy will "sing" again.
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida?
Hope this is false.
Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida.
Numbers out soon!
Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore.
Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race.
With two people, big & over!
Thank you, Northern Mariana Islands!
Thank you, Florida!
Watching other networks and local news.
Really good night!
Crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable.
Thank you, North Carolina!
Thank you Illinois!
I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at  Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory.
She is a winner!
Thank you Marco, I agree!
Will be interviewed on @GMA at 7:00 A.M. Big wins last night!
Will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 7:40.
ENJOY!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. ENJOY!
@pastormarkburns You were great last night and we all very much appreciate it!
Thank you!
@RepTomMarino  Great job on television this morning.
Glad to have you on my side!
Is this what we want for a President?
Yesterday was amazing—5 victories.
Lyin’ Ted Cruz had zero.
Things are going very well!
In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide.
The establishment should save their $$!
Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement.
I greatly appreciate your support!
I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate, but I wish everyone well.
Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins!
Wow, just won Missouri!
Thank you, Missouri!
I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel.
Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump.
Sad!
Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night.
Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse.
Ted can't win!
Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate.
How many times can the same people ask the same question?
Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.
Tough!
The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
@WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.
Trump's is 7,533,692"-a knock.
But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16..
@WSJ is bad at math.
The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!
Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc.
, all 11 of them!
See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday.
Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio.
Two more days and Ohio was mine!
Highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me.
Focus on others Megyn!
Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz?
Let me know.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life!
Join us in Salt Lake City, Utah- tonight!
Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement.
Also backed Jeb.
Lindsey got 0!
Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him.
No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.
With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up.
Can anyone explain this?
Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me.
When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads.
Disgraceful!
Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me.
Remember, I said- NO!
Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally.
Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS!
Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz.
This is good for me!
Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz.
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue.
No wonder he lost!
Join me tomorrow!
Thank you Arizona- I love you!
Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show.
Never worth watching.
Always a hit on Trump!
She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv.
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants?
She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
I guess I have reached yet another "ceiling"  - 49.7%, with four people.
My highest Reuters poll yet!
Thank you!
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet?
Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
Just leaving Salt Lake City, Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions.
Love Utah- will be back!
Watching @loudobbsnews- fantastic show!
Has very interesting take on Paul Ryan.
Heading to Phoneix.
Will be arriving soon.
Tomorrow a big day.
Tremendous crowds expected!
While I have never met @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times, I consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits- he has no sense of the real world!
Reading @nytdavidbrooks of the NY Times is a total waste of time, he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him- dummy!
Landing in Phoenix now.
Tomorrow's events will be amazing!
Thank you- New York!
I love you!
Crazy @megynkelly says I don't (won't) go on her show and she still gets good ratings.
But almost all of her shows are negative hits on me!
If crazy @megynkelly didn't cover me so much on her terrible show, her ratings would totally tank.
She is so average in so many ways!
Great to be back in Arizona!
Wow, @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump, all the time".
The networks are making a fortune off of me!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
THANK YOU ARIZONA!
@jessebwatters- Watching your show from Arizona where we just had a big rally.
It is fantastic- everybody loves it!
@AndreaTantaros- You are a true journalistic professional.
I so agree with what you say.
Keep up the great work!
Thank you- Tucson, Arizona!
A great afternoon with 6,000 supporters!
THANK YOU ARIZONA!
The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great!
Tremendous crowds and spirit.
Just returned but will be going back soon.
Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning.
Enjoy!
Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media?
SAD!
The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!
So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back?
Wrong!
Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.
I will be there!
Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him.
He greeted Pope and others.
Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was.
Not anymore, it is from a different world!
U.S. must be vigilant and smart!
President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels.
He is being treated badly!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close.
Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today!
Watch this clip from earlier this year.
Time & time again I have been right about terrorism.
It’s time to get tough!
Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger!
Shame.
Pres.
Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad.
Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.
No way!
Thank you, Arizona!
Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona.
Thank you, I will never forget!
Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!
Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania.
That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!
Thank you, Arizona!
Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician.
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin’ Ted Cruz.
Honestly, I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror.
She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are!
I will be the best by far in fighting terror.
I’m the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin’ Ted & others are copying me.
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted.
Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing.
I spent a fraction of that and am first!
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!
I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win.
Could not have done it without you Joe!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
N.A.T.O.
is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O.
Why?
It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now!
It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run!
@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION!
Both talk about ISIS, do nothing!
These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!
Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article.
I was so right!
It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media.
Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years.
TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!
@TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on.
Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs.
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe.
Also, many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO!
I alone can fix this problem!
Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria.
This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it!
So sad!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it.
If I lost-monster story!
I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did.
He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted!
Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me.
How am I still number one - by a lot?
Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking.
Weak leaders, ridiculous laws!
The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business.
Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump!
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite!
Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.
were caused by me.
I had NOTHING to do with story!
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump.
Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong.
Illegals out!
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving.
Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me.
I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election.
Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding.
While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others!
I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning.
Enjoy!
Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again.
He is do totally biased.
The things I am saying are correct.
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits!
Happy Easter to all, have a great day!
Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children.
At least 67 dead,400 injured.
Why can't the pundits be honest?
Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again.
I will make it strong and great!
JOBS!
See Lyin' Ted, even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio, not Trump!
The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals.
There are only so many jobs we can give up.
No more!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30.
Things are looking good, had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin!
A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American.
When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn!
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must!
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities.
This will end when I am President!
After the way I beat Gov.
Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me!
Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again.
Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates.
You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!
We need to secure our borders ASAP.
No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows.
Really one-sided and unfair reporting.
Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter.
Look at tapes-nothing there!
Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
Victory press conference was over.
Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions?
Can I press charges?
This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune.
Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference?
What is in her hand??
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you!
Thank you!
@DavidGregory got thrown off of TV by NBC, fired like a dog!
Now he is on @CNN being nasty to me.
Not nice!
THANK YOU, NEW YORK!
Please keep your thoughts & prayers with Melissa Young- Miss Wisconsin 2005.
Congratulations to @CNN for having the wisdom to pick TRUMP!
Thank you- Appleton, Wisconsin!
The Trump Doctrine: Peace Through Strength.
Just had a very nice meeting with @Reince Priebus and the @GOP.
Looking forward to bringing the Party  together --- and it will happen!
THANK YOU, WISCONSIN!
THANK YOU, AMERICA!
THANK YOU, NEW YORK!
The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.
What a dumb group!
The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates.
Try again!
The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people!
For the 1st time in American history, America’s 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me!
Thank you.
Does anybody like Lyin' Ted?
My new radio ad, airing today in Wisconsin!
See you soon!
We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!
Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show.
She totally misrepresents my words and positions!
BAD.
If @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show, her ratings would drop like a rock!
My h to h interview with @AC360 beat her by millions!
I will be in Wisconsin until the election.
Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors.
I will bring jobs back home - make great deals!
Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!
Join me on Monday, April 4th in Milwaukee!
@HeyTammyBruce- Thank you for your nice words on Fox today.
They never use my full statements on nuclear, which you would agree with!
@FoxNews should be ashamed for allowing experts to explain how to make a nuclear attack!
A GREAT DAY IN WISCONSIN!
I will be interviewed by @jdickerson on @FaceTheNation tomorrow morning.
Enjoy!
Thank you Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
I will be on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace this morning.
Enjoy!
Thank you!
Thank you New York, and Pennsylvania!
Thank you Miss Katie's Diner!
I will be in Milwaukee, Wisconsin- tomorrow at 7pmE with @MELANIATRUMP.

Enjoy!
A great night in West Allis, Wisconsin!
Thank you!
A great day in Wisconsin, many stops, many great people!
Melania is joining me on Monday.
Big crowds.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
This Tweet from @realDonaldTrump has been withheld in response to a report from the copyright holder.
Just departing La Crosse, Wisconsin.
Thank you!
Congratulations Jim Herman!
We are all proud of you @TrumpGolf!
Wow, great news from Wisconsin.

Leaving Superior, Wisconsin now.
Thank you!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Enjoy!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Good morning Wisconsin!
The polls are now open!
Wisconsin, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Wow, @Politico is in total disarray  with almost everybody quitting.
Good news -- bad, dishonest journalists!
Still time to get out and VOTE!
It is so great to be back home!
Looking forward to a great rally tonight in Bethpage, Long Island!
I was not scheduled to be on the @oreillyfactor.
Pure fiction!
Unbelievable evening.
Just made a speech in front 17,000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage, Long Island--- great to be home!
Ted Cruz attacked New Yorkers and New York values- we don't forget!
So great to be in New York.
Catching up on many things (remember, I am still running a major business while I campaign) and loving it!
Jennifer is a terrific person.
Looks like I was right about NATO.
I had no doubt.
Nobody beats me on National Security.
Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president.
Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!
A great honor to visit the 9/11 Memorial Museum with my wife, @MELANIATRUMP, today.
The @nytimes purposely covers me so inaccurately.
I want other nations to pay the U.S. for our defense of them.
We are the suckers-no more!
I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign.
Bad system!
How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary?
Great anger - totally unfair!
The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians.
Biggest story in politics.
This will not be allowed!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Enjoy!
This is happening all over our country—great people being disenfranchised by politicians.
Repub party is in trouble!
Why does the liberal media think Bill O'Reilly  (@oreillyfactor) is a complete and total vulgarian?
I don't think so!
Leaving for Albany, New York now, massive crowd expected.
Very exciting!
A very interesting piece, by a very good writer, @KirstenPowers of @USATODAY and @FoxNews.
Tune in & join me live in Albany, New York!
I love you New York!
Join me in Rome, NY- tomorrow!
Thank you Albany, New York!
WOW, great new poll- New York!
Thank you for your support!
THANK YOU California, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania!
See you soon!
I LOVE NEW YORK!
Great to be on @andersoncooper tonight with my wonderful family.
Will be rebroadcast at 12:00 A.M.  (EASTERN).
Join me in Pittsburgh- tonight at 7pmE!
Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity on @FoxNews tonight at 10pm from Pennsylvania.
Enjoy!
Biggest story in politics is now happening in the great State of Colorado where over one million people have been precluded from voting!
Big protest march in Colorado on Friday afternoon!
Don't let the bosses take your vote!
Thank you Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania!
Join me on Saturday- in Syracuse, New York!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you America!
Thank you, @NYPost!
Join me this weekend!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 9:00 A.M. I will be talking about the rigged and boss controlled Republican primaries!
Just arrived in Syracuse, NY.
Big crowd, great place!
We will bring back the desperately needed jobs.
THANK YOU, SYRACUSE!
Will be on Hannity tonight.
Rebroadcast of town hall from Pittsburgh, PA.
Enjoy!
See you tomorrow Dutchess County,  New York!
Thank you California, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania!
I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island.
Big crowd, will be fun!
Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary.
Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses.
It won't work!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me.
I am the one person she doesn't want to run against.
Will be such fun!
I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!
Thank you, California!
Will see you soon!
Thank you for today's endorsement, New York Veteran Police Association!
Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead!
New York, we will make America great again!
Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help.
So many New Yorkers devastated.
Cruz hates New York!
Thank you Buffalo!
I am on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. ENJOY!
A big day for New York and for our COUNTRY!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you Eric!
Join me in Indianapolis, Indiana tomorrow at 3pm!
LETS GO AMERICA!
Who did the House Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues call- when America needed HELP?
Polls close in 3 hours!
Everyone get out and VOTE!
@CNN is so negative it is impossible to watch.
Terrible panel, angry haters.
Bill O  @oreillyfactor said such an amazing thing about me!
Thank you New York!
I love you!
Thank you New York, I will never forget!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Ted Cruz is mathematically out of winning the race.
Now all he can do is be a spoiler, never a nice thing to do.
I will beat Hillary!
Off to Indiana!
Thank you Indiana!
Will be back soon!
Had a meeting with the terrific @GovPenceIN of Indiana.
So excited to campaign in his wonderful state!
We are going to bring steel and manufacturing back to Indiana!
Thank you Maryland- what a great way to conclude the day!
Will be back soon.
I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall.
Hopefully, it will be fun!
Enjoy.
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race.
He said Kasich should get out for same reason.
I think both should get out!
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory.
They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237.
Now he can't get to 1237.
Drop out LYIN' Ted.
I met Prince on numerous occasions.
He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy.
He will be greatly missed!
Thank you for the incredible support, Maryland!
This is a movement!
Thank you, @DonaldJTrumpJr!
Thank you California!
See you soon!
Thank you Indiana!
Was great seeing everyone on Wednesday!
I will be back soon!
Thank you Pennsylvania!
Will be spending the day campaigning in Connecticut, another state where jobs are being stolen by other countries.
I will stop this fast!
Pennsylvania: Cast your vote for Trump for POTUS & ALSO vote for the TRUMP DELEGATES in your congressional district!
Thank you Waterbury, Connecticut!
The Establishment and special interests are absolutely killing our country.
Thank you Bridgeport, Connecticut!
Thank you Delaware!
Lynne Ryan -- just read your great story in the NY Times -- I am proud of you.
Thanks!
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today.
Amazing job!
I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut.
Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!
As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton.
I will win!
@Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight.
Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct!
@AndreBauer  Great job and advice on @CNN  @jaketapper  Thank you!
I will be in Maryland this afternoon for a major rally.
Things are looking good for Tuesday!
I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing.
It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down.
Becoming irrelevant!
Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination.
DESPERATION!
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate.
Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them.
Sad!
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one.
Shows weakness!
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him.
Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally.
Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
Thank you Warwick, Rhode Island!
Thank you West Chester, Pennsylvania!
Passing what was once a vibrant manufacturing area in Pennsylvania.
So sad!
Get out and VOTE tomorrow!
We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania!
The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain.
This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead.
Very dumb!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you @DonaldJTrumpJr & @EricTrump.
Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise.
He should show them, and run as an Independent!
Thank you for the incredible support- Melania, Barron, Ivanka, Jared, Tiffany, Don, Vanessa, Eric, and Lara!
How bad is the New York Times—the most inaccurate coverage constantly.
Always trying to belittle.
Paper has lost its way!
Lets go Pennsylvania!
Thank you for a great day yesterday, Rhode Island!
Thank you America!
Thank you Maryland!
Thank you Pennsylvania!
Thank you Connecticut!
Thank you Rhode Island!
Thank you Delaware!
Thank you!
Thank you!
WE will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thanks!
Thanks Dave!
Thank you Newt!
Agreed!
THANK YOU Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island!
Join me on @greta- from Indianapolis, Indiana at 7pmE!
Enjoy!
Thank you for the endorsement, Coach Bobby Knight!
I will never forget it!
Thank you Laura!
I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally.
Fantastic people!
Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad!
Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana.
Big speech tomorrow with Bobby!
Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech.
I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics!
I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. this morning.
Enjoy!
I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon.
See you there!
So many false and phony T.V. commercials being broadcast in Indiana.
Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide!
Heading to rally with Bobby now!
See you soon!
Thank you Evansville, Indiana!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends with the legendary Coach Bobby Knight- tomorrow morning.
Enjoy!
New York Yankees President, Randy Levine: 'End of the Republican Party' If Donald Trump Not Nominated.
Thank you Costa Mesa, California!
I will be back!
Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up.
What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!
Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!
Thank you Indiana!
We are now at 1001 delegates.
We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged!
@AC360  Anderson, so amazing.
Your mother is, and always has been, an incredible woman!
The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals.
Many are professionals.
They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement!
The economy is bad and getting worse-almost ZERO growth this quarter.
Nobody can beat me on the economy (and jobs).
Trump locks down Delaware GOP delegates.
Thank you @MikeOzanian for the nice comments on @FoxNews today.
Great job!
I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies.
See you there!
Thank you Indiana!
I watched Sen.
Graham @FaceTheNation.
Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support?
Will be in Terre Haute, Indiana in a short while -- big rally!
See you soon!
@KarlRove is a failed Jeb Bushy.
Never says anything good & never will, even after I beat Hillary.
Shouldn't be on the air!
Thank you Terre Haute, Indiana!
Thank you Fort Wayne, Indiana!
Join me in Carmel, Indiana- tomorrow at 4pm!
I will be interviewed on @CNN  @NewDay  at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation".
Actually, she has done poorly with such men!
Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me!
I will bring back jobs to USA.
Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags.
I want America First - so do voters!
I will be campaigning in Indiana all day.
Things are looking great, and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing.
Today will be fun!
I will defeat Crooked Hillary Clinton on 11/8/2016.
Honored to have received the endorsement of Lou Holtz - a great guy!
Thank you Carmel, Indiana!
THANK YOU AMERICA!
Will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE.
Enjoy!
Will be in South Bend, Indiana in a short while -- big rally!
See you soon!
Thank you South Bend, Indiana!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you America!
Polls close at 6pm!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today.
Made all sorts of crazy charges.
Can't function under pressure - not very presidential.
Sad!
Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana.
Thank you Indiana!
Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner.
We have won in every category.
You are very special people-I will never forget!
@oreillyfactor  Please correct, I WON Virginia!
What a great evening we had.
So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary.
The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him!
I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie!
I will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 6:15 A.M. Enjoy!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
Join me in Charleston, WV - tomorrow!
Many reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas.
Totally untrue!
Unfortunately I have other plans.
Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise.
He should show them, & run as an Independent.
Join me tomorrow!
Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business".
She then apologized.
Thank you West Virginia.
Let's keep it going.
Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big.
Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America.
We will do so by bringing back jobs!
Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen".
Thank you Rick!
So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan!
We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party.
Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters!
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability.
As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement.
Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad!
Thank you to teachers across America!
When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now.
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work.
Not much power or insight!
I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run.
This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate.
I will defeat them both.
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American.
I say she’s a fraud!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie.
She is not Native American.
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska.
Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders.
Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant.
She is too easy!
I'm driving her nuts.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective.
Does nothing.
All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
Join me in Washington today!
I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S., and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.
Crooked Hillary has no clue!
I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump!
Thank you.
Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE?
They broke the deal, no honor!
@EdGoeas thank you for your support tonight on @JudgeJeanine.
I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning.
Enjoy!
I will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning.
Enjoy!
@KellyannePolls  Kellyanne, you were fantastic on @meetthepress today.
Keep going - I will win for the people.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie.
It will be the same way with ISIS, and China on trade, and Mexico at the border.
Bad!
On @seanhannity show @FoxNews now.
ENJOY!
I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me!
@drmoore  Russell Moore is truly a terrible representative of Evangelicals and all of the good they stand for.
A nasty guy with no heart!
Wow, I hear @Morning_Joe has gone really hostile ever since I said I won't do or watch the show anymore.
They misrepresent my positions!
Will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBizAlert  at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump.
But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!
If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate.
Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes.
Exactly opposite!
It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary!
It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC.
Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!
It was so great being in Nebraska last week.
Today is the big day--get out and vote!
Hillary has bad judgment!
The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I can’t tell the truth about her husband?
Don’t feel sorry for crooked Hillary!
Thank you West Virginia!
Thank you Nebraska!
Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska.
Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!
I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary.
His time will come!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate.
She has done nothing!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS.
Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
Thanks Piers.
If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary.
Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage.
See media—asking for increase!
Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate?
In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!
If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue.
Great day in D.C. with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership.
Things working out really well!
Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more!
@thehill  Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect—it is just the opposite.
I will not support or endorse a carbon tax!
An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person I have such tremendous respect for.
Thank you, Sheldon!
If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others?
Great new poll- thank you!
Wow, @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible.
Very unprofessional.
Hurting in ratings - bad television!
Thank you for the nice words this morning @KellyRiddell.
Well delivered and totally logical!
The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me.
All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women, they found nothing.
A joke!
Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.
Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women?
The media is TOTALLY dishonest!
Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece.
Massive front page for that!
Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers.
DISHONEST!
The media is really on a witch-hunt against me.
False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail!
Thank you Georgia!
See you soon!
The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong.
Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.
Great new poll- thank you!
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems.
The system is rigged against him.
He should run as an independent!
Run Bernie, run.
That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
The @nytimes is so dishonest.
Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!
A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries".
I set all-time record!
With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud!
Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me.
Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6.
That’s because there were so many positive statements.
The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond.
I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty.
So much for a nice thank you!
What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back.
I said no.
Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton.
She said they had to do with a wedding reception.
Liar!
How can she run?
The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line.
"You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China, NOT WOMEN!
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women.
Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts!
Oregon is voting today.
Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders.
Will be another bad day for her!
Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.
If so, he should run,not her.
Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.?
How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history?
I look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 PM ET.
It will be interesting to see how she treats me—I think she will be very fair.
I will be live tweeting my interview with @megynkelly on the Fox Network tonight at 8!
Enjoy!
Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal?
If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race.
System rigged!
Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary!
Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it.
Apologize?
I will be live tweeting @megynkelly Show in 10 minutes.
Should be interesting.
Will be on Fox Network!
ENJOY!
I like Michael Douglas!
Will go back on for a final question now!
Well, that is it.
Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after!
Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight!
I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters.
I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton!
Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on!
Michael Barbaro, the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women, has in past tweeted badly about me.
Thank you Oregon!
Congratulations to THE MOVEMENT, we have just won THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON.
The vote percentage is even higher than anticipated!
Thank you.
Paul Begala, the dopey @CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.
Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him.
Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me!
Why did Clinton supporter @AlisonForKY declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race?
Thank you Arizona!
See you soon!
Thank you Louisiana!
Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago.
Never happened!
Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke!
My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved.
During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list!
Looks like yet another terrorist attack.
Airplane departed from Paris.
When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?
Great hate and sickness!
How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud?
Thank you Rowanne.
Thank you @LtStevenLRogers.
We will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017!
I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!
Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina.
ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president.
Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild.
I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!
Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential?
I don't think so!
Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back.
ISIS LAUGHS!
Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary.
Four more years of this?
No way!
I am on my way!
See you all soon!
Thanks @piersmorgan!
"Trump is the most unpredictable, extraordinary, entertaining&massively popular candidate this country has ever seen".
Failing @NYTimes will always take a good story about me and make it bad.
Every article is unfair and biased.
Very sad!
Thank you!
An honor to be the first candidate ever endorsed by the @NRA- prior to @GOPconvention!
Great day in Kentucky with Wayne LaPierre, Chris Cox & the @NRA!
Thank you for your wonderful endorsement today @TGowdySC.
It means a great deal to me.
We will not disappoint!
Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that "the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain".
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment.
No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton!
Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me.
She is a very dishonest person!
While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government!
Airports a total disaster!
Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed.
No more guns to protect Hillary!
@CNN is so negative, getting even worse as I get closer.
Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team.
Turning off!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya.
She is reckless and dangerous!
Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country.
You are our true heroes!
Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom.
Wrong!
Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad!
Would be four more years of stupidity!
Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?
Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees.
We can’t allow this.
Time to get smart and protect America!
Join me on Wednesday, May 25th at the Anaheim Convention Center!
Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal!
The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists!
Thank you America!
In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST!
This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Is Hillary really protecting women?
Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measure wait times.
Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread.
’ I will take care of our vets!
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Join me in California or Montana!
While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS.
Nice!
Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs.
Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary.
Read it & you will never be able to vote for her.
Thank you @DailyMail- for setting the failing @NYTimes story straight.
This is what the NYT's should have written!
After raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6M for Vets, I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower.
JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY!
Great honor to receive today's endorsement of @RickSantorum.
Really nice!
Thank you Washington!
Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd!
Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.
Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator.
All talk, no action!
Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie.
I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates.
The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag.
The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!
Thank you Washington!
Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.
Thank you Anaheim, California!
The Inspector General's report on Crooked Hillary Clinton is a disaster..
@kimguilfoyle- just watched you on @OutnumberedFNC- thank you!
Thank you Mr. & Mrs. @TomBarrackJr for the wonderful and magical evening last night.
It will not be forgotten.
I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.
Thank you!
Celebrating 1237!
My wife @MELANIATRUMP, and my children will be featured on @FoxNews with @Greta- 7pmE.
Enjoy!
Today we, together, won the Republican Nomination for President!
Poll data shows that @marcorubio does by far the best in holding onto his Senate seat in Florida.
Important to keep the MAJORITY.
Run Marco!
Bill O'Reilly doing a major special on @OreillyFactor tonight- @FoxNews at 8pmE.
Watch it, should be good!
I am on @oreillyfactor tonight, a big special.
@FoxNews  at 8:00 P.M. ENJOY!
Wow- 25,000 in San Diego, California!
Thank you!!
Thank you @BillyJoel- many friends just told me you gave a very kind shoutout at MSG.
Appreciate it- love your music!
@SanDiegoPD- Fantastic job on handling the thugs who tried to disrupt our very peaceful and well attended rally.
Greatly appreciated!
Great rally in Fresno, California- great crowd!
Thank you!
The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders.
How nice, but what do we get?
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go!
Thank you.
The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people.
I have 73, Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style.
I spend much less money & get much better results!
What we need as Prez!
I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper.
Very dishonest!
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign.
The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan?
Thousands of American lives lost.
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country!
We love them.
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER.
Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY.
Great spirit!
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party.
Be tough, R's!
The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November.
Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!
In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate.
Nice!
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen.
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair.
An Obama pick.
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.
So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good!
News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower!
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so.
Watch!
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave!
It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
Join me in Sacramento, California-tomorrow evening @ 7pm!
I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews.
Enjoy!
Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.
I am getting great credit for my press conference today.
Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings.
Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE.
So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad!
They do anything to belittle - totally biased.
Join me in San Jose, California- tomorrow evening at 7pm!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails.
Many missing!
Same failing @nytimes "reporter" who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!
Thank you Sacramento, California!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president.
Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch!
Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!
Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies.
Wow, USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits.
Verdict: 450 wins, 38 losses.
Isn't that what you want for your president?
Join me in San Jose, California- tonight!
With all of the Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters!
No more HRC.
Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego, I have thousands of great reviews & will win case!
After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?
), so much interest in it!
I will be pres.
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions.
Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office.
People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton!
Reading poorly from the telepromter!
She doesn't even look presidential!
So great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan.
We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!
A 60% increase in Texas Blue Cross/Blue Shield through ObamaCare.
I told you so, there is panic and anger as healthcare costs explode!
@Natalie_Gulbis- Thank you for the nice piece in @SInow / @Golf_com.
Keep up the great work!
Join me in Redding, California- tomorrow at 1:00pm.
On June 22- I will be going to Scotland to celebrate the opening of the newly renovated @TrumpTurnberry Resort, the worlds best.
After @TrumpTurnberry I will be visiting Aberdeen, the oil capital of Europe, to see my great club, @TrumpScotland.
After @TrumpScotland, I will visit @TrumpDoonbeg in Ireland, the magnificent resort fronting on the Atlantic Ocean.
Then, on June 25th- back to the USA to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Terrible jobs report just reported.
Only 38,000 jobs added.
Bombshell!
Rally last night in San Jose was great.
Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall.
Big crowd.
Outside, small group of thugs burned Am flag!
I don't watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore.
Small audience, low ratings!
I hear Mika has gone wild with hate.
Joe is Joe.
They lost their way!
In Crooked Hillary's telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact.
Not honest!
So much interest in my visit to Scotland!
I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.
Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs.
My supporters are far tougher if they want to be, but fortunately they are not hostile.
Thank you Redding, California!
Muhammad Ali is dead at 74!
A truly great champion and a wonderful guy.
He will be missed by all!
Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals.
The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people.
The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
Thank you Attorney General Gonzales, so many people feel this way.
The Clinton News Network, sometimes referred to as @CNN, is getting more and more biased.
I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me.
Shows are predictable garbage!
CNN and MSM is one big lie!
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president.
She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record.
Change!
People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access.
They say what they want without any knowledge.
True of so much of media!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months.
Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women.
She is a total fraud!
A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report.
That's REALLY bad!
I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff.
But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!
Thank you Diamond and Silk!
See, when I said NATO was obsolete because of no terrorism protection, they made the change without giving me credit.
A former Secret Service Agent for President Clinton excoriates Crooked Hillary describing her as ERRATIC & VIOLENT.
In just out book, Secret Service Agent Gary Byrne doesn't believe that Crooked Hillary has the temperament or integrity to be the president!
Thank you!
I will be interviewed tonight on @seanhannity - Enjoy!
Thank you Montana!
Thank you New Jersey!
Thank you South Dakota!
Thank you New Mexico!
Thank you California!
Thank you to all for your wonderful comments on my speech.
I could feel the electricity in thr air.
Nobody is watching @Morning_Joe anymore.
Gone off the deep end - bad ratings.
You won't believe what I am watching now!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents, she had one!
Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him.
Many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me.
As expected, the media is very much against me.
Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win!
Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else.
Obama plus!
Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary.
He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does!
How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up--and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?
Thank you Roseanne, very much appreciated.
Join me!
Pocahontas is at it again!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, one of the least productive U.S. Senators, has a nasty mouth.
Hope she is V.P. choice.
Join me!
The great boxing promoter, Don King, just endorsed me.
Nice!
Heading to D.C. to speak at Faith and Freedom Coalition and visit OPO.
Time for change!
I rarely agree with President Obama- however he is 100% correct about Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Great ad!
Heading to Richmond, Virginia now.
Join me tonight!
Thank you @FaithandFreedom Coalition!
An honor joining you today- to discuss our shared values.
Thank you Richmond, Virginia!
Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog.
Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist!
Sad case- @USATODAY did article saying I don't pay bills- false, only don't pay when work is shoddy, bad, or not done!
They should do same!
Thank you Tampa, Florida!
Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers!
Thank you Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania!
Will be back soon!
Join me on Tuesday- in Greensboro, North Carolina!
Riley Rone was a great young man.
We will miss him dearly.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career.
Very racist!
Really bad shooting in Orlando.
Police investigating possible terrorism.
Many people dead and wounded.
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story.
I would NEVER mock disabled.
Shame!
Horrific incident in FL.
Praying for all the victims & their families.
When will this stop?
When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance.
We must be smart!
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism?
If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar"!
as he slaughtered clubgoers.
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning.
Our leadership is weak and ineffective.
I called it and asked for the ban.
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror.
Hillary just broke-said she would now use!
I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday.
In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror.
I thought people weren’t celebrating?
They were cheering all over, even this savage from Orlando.
I was right.
Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate.
Join me in Atlanta on Wednesday- at noon!
American must now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant.
We cannot admit people into our country without extraordinary screening.
AMERICA FIRST!
Thank you to the LGBT community!
I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.
HAPPY 241st BIRTHDAY to the @USArmy!
THANK YOU!
TONIGHT!
Thank you Greensboro, North Carolina!
Will be back soon!
An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about @POTUS".
The press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people!
I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns.
Thank you Atlanta, Georgia!
Will be back soon!
Join me in Dallas, Texas on Thursday!
Finally an accurate story from the Washington Post!
McAllen, Texas- 8 miles from  U.S. - Mexico border.
The trade deficit rose to a 7yr high thanks to horrible trade policies Clinton supports.
I will fix it fast- JOBS!
Join me in Houston, Texas tomorrow night at 7pm!
Thank you Dallas, Texas!
Amazing crowd last night in Dallas - more spirit and passion than ever before.
Today, all over the great State of Texas!
People very unhappy with Crooked Hillary and Obama on JOBS and SAFETY!
Biggest trade deficit in many years!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
THANK YOU!
Join me in Phoenix, Arizona tomorrow at 4pm!
Thank you @DallasPD!
Thank you- on my way!
The convention in Cleveland will be amazing!
Thank you!
Thank you Houston, Texas!
Join me in Phoenix, Arizona today at 4pm!
In Las Vegas, getting ready to speak!
Thank you Las Vegas, Nevada!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
I love you Arizona!
Thank you!
See you soon Arizona!
Donald Trump's Speech Is a Game Changer.
How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed?
So totally dishonest!
Yesterday's failing @NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech, when in fact, it was packed!
@DJohnsonPGA We are so proud of you Dustin.
Your reaction under pressure was amazing.
First of many Majors.
You are a true CHAMPION!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Hillary says this election is about judgment.
She's right.
Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.
I am "the king of debt".
That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country.
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State.
She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich!
Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief!
She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
Hillary says things can't change.
I say they have to change.
It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism.
Thank you to Donald Rumsfeld for the endorsement.
Very much appreciated.
Clinton's conduct has been "disqualifying".
ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama".
SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now.
But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.
Hillary Clinton’s open borders are tearing American families apart.
I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans.
Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration.
On immigration, I’m consulting with our immigration officers & our wage-earners.
Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street.
Our inner cities have been left behind.
We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border.
CNN, which is totally biased in favor of Clinton, should apologize.
They knew they were wrong.
Here is another CNN lie.
The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility.
I’m not watching it much anymore.
Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech.
She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton.
Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort.
Will be back on Sat.
night!
Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course.
Always support kids!
Just arrived in Scotland.
Place is going wild over the vote.
They took their country back, just like we will take America back.
No games!
Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland.
What a great day, especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote.
Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.
America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK.
We stand together as friends, as allies, & as a people w/a shared history.
New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled..
I want all Americans to succeed together.
President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for...
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead.
The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success.
Good timing, I was here for BREXIT.
Very exciting news conference today!
Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods.
So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!
Arriving @TrumpScotland with @DonaldJTrumpJr & @EricTrump.
Back to New York tonight.
On the 13th tee box @TrumpScotland with my grand daughter, Kai!
Thank you to everyone who came out & joined us @TrumpTurnberry yesterday!
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values.
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs.
That ends when I am President!
Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland.
Turnberry came out magnificently.
My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!
George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.
Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads.
Disgraceful!
Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry.
Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie!
The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.
Very dishonest - why would they do that?
Other polls good!
People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win.
It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo!
She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little.
Close in polls!
Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong.
I said LEAVE will win.
She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement.
The "dirty" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace.
Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled.
Other polls were good.
Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.
The media is unrelenting.
They will only go with and report a story in a negative light..
@CNN is all negative when it comes to me.
I don't watch it anymore.
Check it out - 2nd video on Lying Crooked Hillary is now online!
Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure.
It just never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.
Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic for the future of our country.
She is ill-fit with bad judgment.
Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey.
Will the world ever realize what is going on?
So sad.
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was.
The media makes everything up!
The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker.
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great!
Thank you John.
New Q poll out- we are going to win the whole deal- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Will be in Bangor, Maine today!
Join me- 4pmE at the Cross Insurance Center!
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will.
Not capable!
I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine.
Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better.
The story with Hillary will never change.
New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read!
Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President?
She will destroy them!
One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign.
Done deal!
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx.
$50 million loan.
I have totally terminated the loan!
The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX!
Enjoy!
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement.
Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret.
Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton.
The system is totally rigged.
Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
@TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning.
Keep up the good work!
Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist.
We must get tough.
These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS.
Killer should have never been here.
Thank you for your support!
We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you for inviting me to the Western Conservative Summit in Colorado!
Just returned from Colorado.
Amazing crowd!
When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it.
We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie.
These people are sick!
Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!
If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!
Thank you!
Thank you for your support!
Thank you @greta.
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.
What she did was wrong!
What Bill did was stupid!
It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.
The good news-the people get it!
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G.
was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G.
to work out a deal.
The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.
The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G.
talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G.
in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures".
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G.
So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran.
The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS.
We do not have leadership that can stop this!
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever.
We need change!
Happy 4th of July!
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday.
Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday.
Very impressed, great people!
I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey.
She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt!
Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse.
Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary?
She is flying with him tomorrow.
Who pays?
On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary.
A total disgrace!
It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday.
She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
The system is rigged.
General Petraeus got in trouble for far less.
Very very unfair!
As usual, bad judgment.
FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security.
No charges.
Wow!
Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while.
We will be traveling to North Carolina together today.
My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews.
Enjoy!
I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm.
Enjoy!
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party.
There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning.
Lots of support!
I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder".
Come November 8, she's out!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong.
BAD JUDGEMENT!
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information".
Not fit!
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country.
She is sooooo guilty.
But watch, her time will come!
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know).
Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow.
Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.
I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow.
Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
To all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign.
We must beat Crooked Hillary.
Where is the outrage for this Disney book?
Is this the 'Star of David' also?
Dishonest media!
Great being in Cincinnati, Ohio last night- thank you!
Off to Washington D.C. now.
Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate.
Very interesting day!
These are people who love our country!
Thank you Rep.
Collins!
Thank you Speaker @PRyan!
After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.
Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers...
Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.
Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN?
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
Way to go @serenawilliams  - you are a true champion.
Proud of you!
New poll - thank you!
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton.
We are a divided nation!
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think.
He is living in a world of the make believe!
The media is so dishonest.
If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.
They think the public is stupid!
I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies.
Happily, few people are watching - dead network!
Join me in Westfield, Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm!
Thoughts and prayers with the victims, and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph, Michigan.
Great poll- Florida!
Thank you!
Senior United States District Judge Robert E. Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued..
Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse.
Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities.
Not good!
For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind.
I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.
This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence.
I will make America safe again for everyone.
Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.
He will endorse her today - fans angry!
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters.
They are not happy that he is selling out!
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms.
People first.
The American people agree.
I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 8pm.
Enjoy!
Thank you Iowa- see you soon!
THANK YOU INDIANA!
Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.
Her mind is shot - resign!
Thank you!
Thank you Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania!
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall.
We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
The Republican platform is most  pro-Israel of all time!
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves?
Think about it and let me know!
Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party.
I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct?
Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach.
What was she thinking?
If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan.
Details to follow.
Great new poll- thank you America!
Another new poll.
Thank you for your support!
Join the MOVEMENT today!
I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA.
Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France.
Many dead and injured.
When will we learn?
It is only getting worse.
In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.
My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France.
We are with you in every way!
Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable.
Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!
I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate.
Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.
Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana).
My first choice from start!
Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy.
Look what's happening!
Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests.
She will sell our country down the tubes!
Thank you!

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing.
I will never forget.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia.
GREAT JOB!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud.
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland.
Will lead to special results for our country.
We will Make America Great Again!
As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made.
Bernie said she has bad judgement!
I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today..
@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative.
Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary!
I don't watch.
The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close.
We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today.
How many law enforcement and people have to...
We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police.
Our country is divided and out of control.
I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects!
Bad times for divided USA!
Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching.
We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!
President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue.
Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!
Thank you Mahoning County, Ohio!
See you soon!
Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania.
Place looks beautiful!
@CNN is the worst.
They go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump!
VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!
Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!
It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania.
Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible.
Very proud!
The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention.
Very exciting!
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States.
I will work hard and never let you down!
AMERICA FIRST!
Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night.
I am very proud of you!
Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena.
More than in past years.
In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state.
Jobs!
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
URGENT: we’ve just announced a $2 million fundraising goal tonight.
Please stand with us!
John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!
Thank you @IngrahamAngle!
Thank you to Governor @ScottWalker for such warm support.
Great speech!
Thank you @ScottWalker!

Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge!
I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway.
No big deal!
Our next Vice President of the United States of America, Gov.
@Mike_Pence!
@mike_pence was fantastic tonight.
Arena was packed, totally electric!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Great job @EricTrump!
Proud of you!
I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible.
Ivanka intros me tonight!
Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!
Limited opportunity to get your OFFICIAL Trump gear!
Shop now!
Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united.
Great love in the arena!
Great job @IvankaTrump!
We’ve just set a new goal: raise $4 million from our grassroots supporters by MIDNIGHT!

FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOMINATION!
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
What a great four days in Cleveland.
So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all.
The police and Secret Service were fantastic!
Thank you Cleveland.
We love you and will be back many times!
One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions.
Great unity!
Big T.V. ratings!
Another attack, this time in Germany.
Many killed.
God bless the people of Munich.
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn.
How to defeat radical Islam.
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for.
Philly fight?
Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks.
Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice.
Bernie fought for nothing!
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate.
Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders.
Mock his heritage and much more.
On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious.
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania.
Against steelworkers and miners.
Husband signed NAFTA.
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs.
I will bring jobs back!
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved.
Job killer!
I will bring jobs back and get wages up.
People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years.
Clinton killed jobs!
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together.
ISIS and our other enemies are drooling.
They don't look presidential to me!
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night.
From the heart!
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters.
Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak.
So much for a movement!
Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me.
Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Looks like the Bernie people will fight.
If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time.
Kaine stands for opposite!
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution".
He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer.
He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect.
SAD!
Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated.
The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump.
@FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher.
Don't watch CNN!
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player.
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS.
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing!
E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great.
Thank you!
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes.
No way they are going to fix America's problems.
ISIS & all others laughing!
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
Thank you!
If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all!
They laughed at Bernie.
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe).
Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess.
But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Great POLL numbers are coming out all over.
People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse.
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon!
Thank you OHIO!
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters.
Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold.
He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money.
The V.P. a joke!
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.
He asked if he could have pictures taken with me.
I said fine.
He then trashes on air!
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future!
I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution.
We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.
All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it!
Waste of time.
Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day.
If you listen to the other two, they are fawning.
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order.
Pocahontas bombed last night!
Sad to watch.
Join us tomorrow in Scranton, Pennsylvania at 3pm!
Join us in Toledo, Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm!
Thank you New Hampshire!
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump.
Crazy!
For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.
I’m with you!
I will work hard and never let you down.
Make America Great Again!
I'm with you!
I will work hard and never let you down.
Make America Great Again!
I'm with you!
I will work hard and never let you down.
Make America Great Again!
You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing).
Please get your facts straight - thanks.
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible.
Highly overrated!
I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena.
Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.
As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius".
America 1st!
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country.
No recognition - SAD!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally.
Get tough!
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about.
The danger is massive.
NO!
Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy.
Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one.
Join our next Vice President, @Mike_Pence in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday!
If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!
Great new poll - thank you!
Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers!
As President, I will bring jobs back and get wages up for Americans who need it most.
Thank you Pennsylvania!
Join me live in Toledo, Ohio!
Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year.
We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!
Our country does not feel 'great already' to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair.
President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn’t exist.
Bernie caved!
A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.
Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office.
It will only go further down under Clinton.
Great to be back in Iowa!
As President, I WILL fix this rigged system and only answer to YOU, the American people!
I will once again write a $1 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!
Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
This is a MOVEMENT!
I will once again write a $1 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!
Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Hillary will never reform Wall Street.
She is owned by Wall Street!
Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke.
@CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead.
It is only getting worse.
People want LAW AND ORDER!
Join @mike_pence at the University of Northwestern Ohio- tonight at 7pm.
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech.
Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS.
If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!
Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign".
Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
Thank you!
The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech.
He wishes he didn't make that deal!
In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse.
Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary.
She sold them out, V.P. pick!
I am watching Crooked Hillary speak.
Same old stuff, our country needs change!
What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Join me in Colorado Springs at 2pm- or in Denver tonight at 7pm!
Even Bill is tired of the lies, SAD!
Thank you Colorado Springs.
Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers in Colorado!
Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.
As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games.
Same as last time w/ Bernie.
Unacceptable!
Thank you Denver, Colorado!
Colorado was amazing yesterday!
So much support.
Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.
Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters.
Her foreign wars,  NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years.
I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs.
WE will bring back the  'American Dream!
Join me Monday in Columbus, Ohio & Harrisburg, Pennsylvania!
While I am in OH & PA - you can also join @Mike_Pence in Nevada on Mon!
Just got back from Colorado.
The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible.
Big crowds!
I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal!
Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it.
Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes.
A formula for disaster!
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch.
Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania.
Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico.
END!
Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS.
This is a general I will like!
Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania.
It would be a major media event!
Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.
CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.
Thank you!
We crushed the original goal!
I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our end-of-month goal!
Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!
I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention.
Am I not allowed to respond?
Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention.
I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us.
The failing @nytimes is a joke.
@CNN is laughable!
Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President.
Already in Crimea!
So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push.
That's what I said!
Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno, Nevada- tonight at 7pm!
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....
that's really saying something!
Thank you Oklahoma & Virginia!
Thank you Columbus, Ohio!
I will be back soon.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors.
Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS.
Silence at CNN.
Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence.
They don’t want them heard.
Join me in Florida on Wednesday!
Thanks to @pnehlen for your kind words, very much appreciated.
Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries.
That will end when I win!
Just leaving Mechanicsburg, PA.
Incredible crowd-- so enthusiastic!
Will be back soon.
Great afternoon in Ohio & a great evening in Pennsylvania - departing now.
See you tomorrow Virginia!

Great day in Virginia.
Crowd was fantastic!
There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before.
I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support.
Beat Crooked H!
Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran.
Scandal!
THANK YOU Daytona Beach, Florida!
Thank you to the amazing law enforcement officers today- in Daytona Beach, Florida!
Thank you for your support of my candidacy!
Thank you Jacksonville, Florida!
Looking forward to IA & WI with Gov.
Pence, tomorrow.
Join us!
Great meeting all of you.
This group knocked on 50K doors & counting here in Maine, thank you!
Happy 226th Birthday to the United States Coast Guard.
Thank you @USCG!
Thank you Portland, Maine!
See you tomorrow w/ Gov.
@Mike_Pence, Iowa & Wisconsin!
President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.
Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!
President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.
I won't dodge questions as your President.
The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!
Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President.
I am counting on your help to defeat Hillary Clinton and her cronies.
Let's Make America Great Again!
I'm with YOU.
I will work hard and never let you down.
Make America Great Again!
I'm with YOU.
I will work hard and never let you down.

Governor @Mike_Pence and I appreciate your support!
DON'T LET HILLARY CLINTON DO IT AGAIN!
Thank you Green Bay, Wisconsin!
Governor @Mike_Pence and I will be back soon.
Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions.
Let us all see what happens!
Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails.
Very dangerous!
Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president!
Look up the word "BRAINWASHED".

Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things!
I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton, I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win!
Thank you Windham, New Hampshire!
I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard.
Look at the job she has done in Baltimore.
She is a joke!
The media is going crazy.
They totally distort so many things on purpose.
Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more.
Very dishonest!
Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
Join me in Fayetteville, North Carolina tomorrow evening at 6pm.
My economic policy speech will be carried live at 12:15 P.M. Enjoy!
Thank you Alex!
Thank you!
Thank you @RepLouBarletta!
Thank you Senator David Perdue!
Thank you Congressman Steven Palazzo!
Thank you Newt!
Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.
'As Senator Clinton promised 200,000 jobs in Upstate New York - her efforts fell flat.
Being in Detroit today was wonderful.
Quick stop in Ohio to meet with some of our great supporters.
Just got back home!
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends now!
I am running against the Washington insiders, just like I did in the Republican Primaries.
These are the people that have made U.S. a mess!
Act NOW for your chance to have a private lunch with Eric Trump & tour of campaign HQ at Trump Tower in NYC.

Thank you Wilmington, North Carolina!
Thank you @SenatorFischer!
Thank you Senator @ChuckGrassley!
When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?
Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance.
I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
@dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN.
Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings.
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas.
I will be interviewed on @greta tonight at 7pm.
Enjoy!
Great meeting w/ coal miners & leaders from the Virginia coal industry- thank you!
No such meeting or conversation ever happened - a made up story by "low ratings" @CNN.
Thank you Abingdon, Virginia!
Reuters just announced that Secret Service never spoke to me or my campaign.
Made up story by @CNN is a hoax.
Totally dishonest.
Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.
Thank you Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
This is no surprise.
Constant phony reporting from failing @CNN turns everyone off.
The American people get it!
Will be doing @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm.
Enjoy!
I am counting on your help to defeat Hillary Clinton and her cronies.
Let's Make America Great Again!
I'm with YOU.
I will work hard and never let you down.
Make America Great Again!
Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS, & MVP.
THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?
A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda.
What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out.
They can't!
ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State.
When will the dishonest media report the facts!
The Establishment and special interests are absolutely killing our country.
I'm with YOU!
I will work hard and never let you down.
Make America Great Again!
I'm with YOU.
I will work hard and never let you down.

Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you!
Thank you Erie, Pennsylvania!
Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee.
Enjoy!
The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction.
Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources.
Very dishonest!
I am truly enjoying myself while running for president.
The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY.
How can she run for Pres.
The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened.
Their reporting is fiction.
The media protects Hillary!
The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change.
My rallies are not covered properly by the media.
They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media.
She is not a talented person or politician.
The dishonest media refuses to expose!
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process.
People get it!
It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.
The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments.
Sad!
Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets....
Will be on @SeanHannity tonight at 10pmE - delivering an important speech live from Wisconsin.
Join me in North Carolina - tomorrow at 7:30pm!
Thank you Governor @ScottWalker & @GOP Chairman @Reince Priebus.
A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, & lost opportunities.
We are going to make this a government of the people once again!
Will be participating in a town hall event- hosted by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews.
Enjoy!
They will soon be calling me MR.
BREXIT!
Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you Charlotte, North Carolina!
We are one nation.
When one state hurts, we all hurt.
We must all work together - to lift each other up.
Thank you to NC for last evenings great reception.
The speech was a great success.
Heading now to Louisiana & another speech tonight in MI.
The reporting at the failing @nytimes gets worse and worse by the day.
Fortunately, it is a dying newspaper.
Thank you to everyone for all of the nice comments, by Twitter, pundits and otherwise for my speech last night.
Great job by @EricTrump on interview with @BillHemmer on @FoxNews.
Thank you Michigan.
This is a MOVEMENT.
We are going to MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
We are one nation.
When one hurts, we all hurt.
We must all work together-to lift each other up..
@Franklin_Graham @BillyNungesser @SamaritansPurse- so humbled by my time w/ you.
You are in our thoughts & prayers.
Thank you @JerryJrFalwell- will see you soon.
Just leaving Virginia - really big crowd, great enthusiasm!
Will be interviewed on @JudgeJeanine at 9:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Will be back soon Virginia.
We are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
We will bring America together as ONE country again – united as Americans in common purpose and common dreams.
Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them.
Something very big is happening!
Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street.
Media is protecting her!
I heard that @Morning_Joe was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D, a big failure in TV (& someone I helped), was nasty.
Irrelevant!
Tried watching low-rated @Morning_Joe this morning,  unwatchable!
@morningmika is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!
Some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend, @morningmika.
Two clowns!
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Eastern.
ENJOY!
Great meeting with active & retired law enforcement officers- at the Fraternal Order of Police lodge in Akron, Ohio.
Just leaving Akron, Ohio, after a packed rally.
Amazing people!
Going now to Texas..
@AnnCoulter's new book, 'In Trump We Trust, comes out tomorrow.
People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is!
The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories.
Don't buy, boring!
I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!
It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact,  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department.
LIE!
President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing.
Too little, too late!
Join me in Tampa, Florida- tomorrow at 1pmE!
In Austin, Texas with some of our amazing Border Patrol Agents.
I will not let them down!
Will be participating in a Town Hall tonight on @SeanHannity at 10pmE from Austin, Texas.
Enjoy!
Thank you Travis County, Texas!
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of those affected by two powerful earthquakes in Italy and Myanmar.
I will not let the families of The Remembrance Project down!
Great new poll Florida - thank you!
New national poll released.
A great afternoon in Tampa, Florida.
Thank you!
Thank you for your support!
Great Governor @Mike_Pence is in Indiana to help lead the relief efforts after tornadoes struck.
True leadership.
Thoughts and prayers to the great people of Indiana.
You will prevail!
Poll numbers are starting to look very good.
Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah.
All numbers rising, national way up.
Wow!
Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society.
She should be ashamed of herself!
Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument!
Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me.
No policy, and always very short (stamina).
Media gives her a pass!
CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.
The Clinton's are the real predators...
What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me.
Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics.
I will fix it!
Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe.
Apologize!
I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion.
How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized?
I will be interviewed by @kimguilfoyle  at 7pm on @FoxNews.
Thank you @TeamTrump Florida.
Keep me updated, and lets get those 100,000 registered voters!
Will be in Phoenix, Arizona on Wednesday.
Changing venue to much larger one.
Demand is unreal.
Polls looking great!
New polls - join the MOVEMENT today.
Heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the MIDWEST.
Coming in from our southern border.
We need strong border & WALL!
Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago.
Just what I have been saying.
African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!
My condolences to Dwyane Wade and his family, on the loss of Nykea Aldridge.
They are in my thoughts and prayers.
Just landed in Iowa to attend a great event in honor of wonderful Senator @JoniErnst.
Look forward to being with all of my friends.
Thank you Iowa!
It was an honor to have the amazing Root family join me in Iowa.
I have been so inspired by their courage & bravery.
NATIONAL DEBT  January 2009 = $10.6 TRILLION August 2016 = $19.
Join me Tuesday in Everett, Washington at the Xfinity Arena!
Thank you Arizona!
Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington - today we honor the enduring fight for justice, equality and opportunity.
I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records.
I have no problem in doing so!
Hillary?
I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona.
Big crowds, looking for a larger venue.
Look how bad it is getting!
How much more crime, how many more shootings, will it take for African-Americans and Latinos to vote Trump=SAFE!
Inner-city crime is reaching record levels.
African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!
Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C.
Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.
Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!
Join me this Wednesday in Phoenix, Arizona at 6pm!
Join me this Thursday in Wilmington, Ohio at noon!
From day one I said that I was going to build a great wall on the SOUTHERN BORDER, and much more.
Stop illegal immigration.
Watch Wednesday!
Thank you America!
Thank you North Carolina!
I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.
Thank you Washington!
Together, WE will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb".
Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana, and now she didn't go to Mexico.
She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Great trip to Mexico today  - wonderful leadership and high quality people!
Look forward to our next meeting.
Just arrived in Arizona!
Mexico will pay for the wall - 100%!
There will be no amnesty!
Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or the stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Mexico will pay for the wall!
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great review of the speech on immigration last night.
Thank you also to the great people of Arizona!
Poll numbers way up - making big progress!
Thank you for having me this morning @AmericanLegion.
I enjoyed my time with everyone!
I am promising you a new legacy for America.
We're going to create a new American future.
Thank you OHIO!
I will be interviewed by @ericbolling tonight at 8pm on the @oreillyfactor.
Enjoy!
Just heard that crazy and very dumb @morningmika had a mental breakdown while talking about me on the low ratings @Morning_Joe.
Joe a mess!
People will be very surprised by our ground game on Nov.
We have an army of volunteers and people with GREAT SPIRIT!
I visited our Trump Tower campaign headquarters last night, after returning from Ohio and Arizona, and it was packed with great pros - WIN!
Great new poll Iowa - thank you!
Thank you Great Faith Ministries International, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, and Detroit!
I am returning to the Pensacola Bay Center in Florida- Friday, 9/9/16 at 7pm.
Join me!
Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside.
Inside a large and wonderful crowd!
@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.
Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release.
Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea.
A total lie - and taken over during O term!
The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake.
Sad!
The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.
Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs.
Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED.
How can this be happening?
President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new?
Obama is not a natural deal maker.
Only makes bad deals!
Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac!
Thank you American Legion Post 610- for hosting @Mike_Pence & I for a roundtable with labor leaders.
Heading to Youngstown, Ohio now- some great polls.
Thank you Ohio!
The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92.
She was very special!
China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore".
Terrible!
As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Join me in Pensacola, Florida this Friday at 7pm!
Thank you to all of our amazing military families, service members, and veterans.
Great meeting with military spouses in Virginia- joined by @IvankaTrump, @LaraLeaTrump, @GenFlynn & @MayorRGiuliani.
I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor tonight at 11pmE @FoxNews.
Enjoy!
Wow - thank you Pensacola, FL.
See you Friday at 7pm -- join me!
Thank you Peter - if elected, I will think big for our country & never let the American people down!
Thank you to our fantastic veterans.
The reviews and polls from almost everyone of my Commander-in-Chief presentation were great.
Nice!
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the nice reviews of last night.
Wow, reviews are in - THANK YOU!
Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night.
She's being decimated by the media!
Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past.
She is totally confused.
Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.
Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC.
More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum.
It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night.
It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.
Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum.
Thank you!
The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time.
I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me.
A joke!
@CNN is unwatchable.
Their news on me is fiction.
They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.
Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
Henry McMaster, Lt.
Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly.
Funny!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Great honor to be endorsed by popular & successful @gov_gilmore of VA.
A state that I very much want to win-THX Jim!
Thank you Ohio.
Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Will be delivering a major speech tonight - live on @oreillyfactor at 8:10pm from Pensacola, Florida.
Thank you Florida - we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Dummy writer @tonyschwartz, who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted!
I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me.
Never liked his style.
Super lib, Crooked H supporter.
Irrelevant dope!
Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible.
Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S!
Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people.
I think it will cost her at the Polls!
Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad.
Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass.
SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment.
What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
Will be on @CNBC at @7:22.
Enjoy!
Stopped by @TrumpDC to thank all of the tremendous men & women for their hard work!
Just got back from Asheville,  North Carolina, where we had a massive rally.
The spirit of the crowd was unbelievable.
Thank you!
Join me in Clive, Iowa tomorrow at noon!
Heading to Iowa- join me today at noon!
Join us today!
Thank you Clive, Iowa!
CHILD CARE REFORMS THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you @RepReneeEllmers!
Thank you Rep.
@MarshaBlackburn!
Thank you Rep.
@CynthiaLummis!
Why isn't President Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?
Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years.
Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass?
Thank you Ohio - see you tonight!
Great poll Florida - thank you!
Thank you @ATFD17!
Thank you Florida- can't wait to see you Friday in Miami!
Thank you Ohio!
Just landed in Canton for a rally at the Civic Center.
Honor to have been interviewed by the very wonderful @bishopwtjackson in Detroit last week - tune in at 9pmE.
Enjoy!
Great evening in Canton, Ohio-thank you!
We are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Great poll out of Nevada- thank you!
See you soon.
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow at 7am.
Enjoy!
I was never a fan of Colin Powell after his weak understanding of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq = disaster.
We can do much better!
Will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 A.M. Enjoy!
Thank you for having me!
I enjoyed the tour and spending time with everyone.
See you soon.
Thank you to all of our law enforcement officers - across America!
Thank you @JerryJrFalwell!
Full transcript of economic plan- delivered to the Economic Club of New York.
I will be interviewed by @jessebwatters on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm.
Enjoy!
Will be joining @jimmyfallon on @FallonTonight at 11:35pmE tonight.
Enjoy!
Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the WORLD'S great magnet for innovation & job creation!
Thank you for a great evening - Laconia, New Hampshire -- will be back soon!
I am now going to the brand new Trump International, Hotel D.C. for a major statement.
I am truly honored and grateful for receiving SO much support from our American heroes...
Great parade in The Villages- I love you all.
Just leaving Miami for Houston, Oklahoma and Colorado.
Miami crowd was fantastic!
Just arrived in Texas - have been informed two @fortworthpd officers have been shot.
My thoughts and prayers are with them.
My thoughts and prayers go out to the @PhillyPolice & @Penn police officers- in Philadelphia.
Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away.
Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail?
Maybe not!
I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
He knows nothing about me.
But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
@CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse.
Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!
Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column.
A neurotic dope!
Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends she knows me well--wrong!
The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly.
They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!
My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent.
I said no (for now), but they are watching.
Heading to Colorado for a big rally.
Massive crowd, great people!
Will be there soon - the polls are looking good.
Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates.
Look at the mess the U.S. is in.
Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama.
I would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY - to the United States Air Force!!
Under the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad.
Time to change the playbook!
Terrible attacks in NY, NJ and MN this weekend.
Thinking of victims, their families and all Americans!
We need to be strong!
Will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 A.M.  Enjoy.
Great job once again by law enforcement!
We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!
Once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & its people- how did he get thru system?
Hillary Clinton's weakness while she was Secretary of State, has emboldened terrorists all over the world..
I will be interviewed on the @oreillyfactor - tonight from Florida, now.
Enjoy!
Together, we will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
Amazing rally in Florida - this is a MOVEMENT!
Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years.
Now she has new ideas.
It is time for change.
Thank you Georgia!
Thank you Nevada!
Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
Heading to North Carolina for two big rallies.
Will be there soon.
We will bring jobs back where they belong!
Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest.
Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!
Thank you High Point, NC!
Thank you Kenansville, North Carolina!
It is a MOVEMENT - not a campaign.
Leaving the past behind, changing our future.
The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic.
We must come together to make America safe again.
Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end.
To those injured, get well soon.
We need unity & leadership.
Thank you Toledo, Ohio!
It is so important for you to get out and VOTE on November 8, 2016!
Great new polls!
Thank you Nevada, North Carolina & Ohio..
@YoungDems4Trump  Thank you!
I will be interviewed from Cleveland, Ohio, on @seanhannity - Tonight at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Will be on @foxandfriends now.
Join me in Roanoke, Virginia on Saturday evening at 6pm!
This is more than a campaign- it is a movement.
Spoke with Governor @PatMcCroryNC of North Carolina today.
He is doing a tremendous job under tough circumstances.
Tomorrow's the day!
Knock on doors and make calls with us on National Day of Action!
Hillary Clinton just lost every Republican she ever had, including Never Trump, all farmers & sm.
biz, by saying she’ll tax estates at 65%.
Join me in Roanoke, Virginia tomorrow at the Berglund Center- Coliseum ~ 6pm!
Crooked Hillary's bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand.
Dem pols said no way, dumb!
Today is the day!
Knock on doors and make calls with us on National Day of Action!
The @SenTedCruz endorsement was a wonderful surprise.
I greatly appreciate his support!
We will have a tremendous victory on November 8th.
Will be back in Virginia tonight- for a 6pm rally at the Berglund Center in Roanoke.
Join me!
If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!
Thank you Roanoke, Virginia - this a MOVEMENT - join us today!
Many on the team and staff of Bernie Sanders have been treated badly by the Hillary Clinton campaign - and they like Trump on trade, a lot!
Bernie Sanders gave Hillary the Dem nomination when he gave up on the e-mails.
That issue has only gotten bigger!
Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant.
Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses.
N.C. riots!
Really sad news: The great Arnold Palmer, the "King," has died.
There was no-one like him - a true champion!
He will be truly missed.
New national Bloomberg poll just released - thank you!
My team of deplorables will be managing my Twitter account for this evenings debate.
Tune in!
Why isn't Hillary Clinton 50 points ahead?
@HillaryClinton channels John Kerry on trade: she was for bad trade deals before she was against them..
@HillaryClinton has been part of the rigged DC system for 30 years?
Why would we take policy advice from her?
A Clinton economy = more taxes and more spending!
HILLARY'S BAD TAX HABIT!
This is the simple fact about @HillaryClinton: she is a typical politician - all talk, no action.
I will stand with police and protect ALL Americans!
Hillary Clinton is the only candidate on stage who voted for the Iraq War.
Hillary Clinton failed all over the world.
Russia has more warheads than ever, N Korea is testing nukes, and Iran got a sweetheart deal to keep theirs.
Thanks, @HillaryClinton..
Nothing on emails.
Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation..
Thank you Senator @TedCruz!
Thank you Governor @Mike_Pence!
Lets MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN with the American people.
Thank you Governor @TerryBranstad!
Wow, did great in the debate polls (except for @CNN - which I don't watch).
Thank you!
@newtgingrich just said "a historic victory for Trump".
NICE!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Great debate poll numbers - I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 to discuss.
Enjoy!
I really enjoyed the debate last night.
Crooked Hillary says she is going to do so many things.
Why hasn't she done them in her last 30 years?
I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate - except for the little watched @CNN poll.
Hillary's been failing for 30 years in not getting the job done - it will never change.
Thank you!
'U.S. Murders Increased 10.
Such a great honor.
Final debate polls are in - and the MOVEMENT wins!
Thank you for your endorsement, @GovernorSununu.
Well, now they're saying that I not only won the NBC Presidential Forum, but last night the big debate.
Nice!
In the last 24 hrs.
we have raised over $13M from online donations and National Call Day, and we’re still going!
Thank you America!
Great afternoon in Little Havana with Hispanic community leaders.
Thank you for your support!
'CNBC, Time magazine online polls say Donald Trump won the first presidential debate' via @WashTimes.
Once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.
Join the MOVEMENT today!
Join me for a 3pm rally - tomorrow at the Mid-America Center in Council Bluffs, Iowa!
Unbelievable evening in Melbourne, Florida w/ 15,000 supporters- and an additional 12,000 who could not get in.
My supporters are the best!
$18 million from hard-working people who KNOW what we can be again!
Every on-line poll, Time Magazine, Drudge etc.
, has me winning the debate.
Thank you to Fox & Friends for so reporting!
Join me in Council Bluffs, Iowa- today at 3pm!
Melania and I extend our deepest condolences to the family of Shimon Peres...
An honor to meet with the Polish American Congress in Chicago this morning!
Thank you Council Bluffs, Iowa!
Will be back soon.
Join me live in Waukesha, Wisconsin for an 8pmE rally!
Joining @oreillyfactor from Waukesha, Wisconsin - now, live!
Enjoy!
Thank you Waukesha, Wisconsin!
Join me in Bedford, New Hampshire- tomorrow at 3:00pm.
Can't wait to see everyone!
Will be in Novi, Michigan this Friday at 5:00pm.
Join the MOVEMENT!
My condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in NJ and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders.
Join me in Manheim, Pennsylvania on Saturday at 7pm!
Thank you for joining me this afternoon, New Hampshire!
Will be back soon.
While Hillary profits off the rigged system, I am fighting for you!
Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings.
With people like @donlemon, who could expect any more?
Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it.
There are no sources, they are just made up lies!
Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!
Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT!
Hillary was set up by a con.
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media.
If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist.
The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas & Arizona papers & now USA Today will lose readers!
The people get it!
Why isn't Hillary 50 points ahead?
For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!
Join me in Pueblo, Colorado on Monday afternoon at 3pm!
Thank you for your support - on my way now!
See you soon.
Thank you Novi, Michigan!
Crooked H is nasty to Sanders supporters behind closed doors.
Owned by Wall St and Politicians, HRC is not with you.
I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided "spin" that followed.
This despite the really bad microphone.
The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio & sound level was very bad.
So why didn't they fix it?
Wow, just saw the really bad @CNN ratings.
People don't want to watch bad product that only builds up Crooked Hillary.
Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight.
We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them.
I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity.
Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!
Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters.
Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world.
Just announced that Iraq (U.S.) is preparing for battle to reclaim Mosul.
Why do they have to announce this?
Makes mission much harder!
Join me in Henderson, Nevada on Wednesday at 11:30am!
Thank you Pueblo, Colorado!
We must bring the truth directly to hard-working Americans who want to take our country back.
Thank you Colorado!
Join me in Reno, Nevada on Wednesday at 3:30pm at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center!
Join me in Reno, Nevada tomorrow at 3:30pm!
I will be watching the great Governor @Mike_Pence and live tweeting the VP debate tonight starting at 8:30pm est!
Enjoy!
My childcare plan makes a difference for working families - more money, more freedom.
Thank you ARIZONA!
This is a MOVEMENT like nobody has ever seen before.
Join the MOVEMENT!
Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton's statement on how bad ObamaCare is.
Hillary not happy.
As I have been saying, REPEAL AND REPLACE!
Wow, @CNN is so negative.
Their panel is a joke, biased and very dumb.
I'm turning to @FoxNews where we get a fair shake!
I will be live-tweeting the V.P. Debate.
Very exciting!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Here we go - Enjoy!
Both are looking good!
Now we begin!
@megynkelly- I am in Nevada.
Sorry to inform you Kellyanne is in the audience.
Better luck next time..
@mike_pence is doing a great job - so far, no contest!
@timkaine oversaw unemployment INCREASE by 179,249 while @mike_pence DECREASED unemployment in Indiana by 113,826..
@HillaryClinton Sneers At Millions Of Average Americans.
I agree Mike - thank you to all of our law enforcement officers!
@timkaine is the ANTI-DEFENSE SENATOR.
ICYMI: PENCE: I RAN A STATE THAT WORKED; KAINE RAN A STATE THAT FAILED...
Mike Pence won big.
We should all be proud of Mike!
The constant interruptions last night by Tim Kaine should not have been allowed.
Mike Pence won big!
Beautiful morning- thank you @ICLV!
About to begin a rally here in Henderson, Nevada.
New Reuters poll just out- thank you!
Thank you Henderson, NV.
This is a MOVEMENT like never seen before!
Bill Clinton is right: Obamacare is 'crazy', 'doesn't work' and 'doesn't make sense'.
Thanks Bill for telling the truth.
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your kind remarks on the important issue of PTSD and the dishonest media.
Great to be in Arizona yesterday!
EARLY VOTING: MN & IA already underway, more states coming up in the next week: OH, ME, AZ, IN — check w/local officials for details & VOTE!
Thank you South Carolina!
Everyone has to get out and VOTE on 11/8/16.
Reuters polling just out- thank you!
Amazing rally in Reno, Nevada- thank you.
Such a great honor!
Pennsylvania poll just released.
Two rallies there on Mon- join me!
New Virginia poll- thank you!
Praying for everyone in Florida.
Hoping the hurricane dissipates, but in any event, please be careful.
Volunteer to be a Trump Election Observer.
Sign up today!
Thank you Tennessee!
Thoughts & prayers with the millions of people in the path of Hurricane Matthew.
Here is my statement.
Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!
The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly -  I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN!
Thank you to my great supporters in Wisconsin.
I heard that the crowd and enthusiasm was unreal!
Tremendous support (except for some Republican "leadership").
Thank you.
So many self-righteous hypocrites.
Watch their poll numbers - and elections - go down!
The Palestinian terror attack today reminds the world of the grievous perils facing Israeli citizens....
It’s this simple.
“Make America Great Again”.
I’m not proud of my locker room talk.
But this world has serious problems.
We need serious leaders.
There’s never been anyone more abusive to women in politics than Bill Clinton.
If I win-I am going to instruct my AG to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation bc there's never been anything like your lies.
Basically nothing Hillary has said about her secret server has been true.
Hillary’s 33,000 deleted emails about her daughter’s wedding.
That’s a lot of wedding emails.
ATTN: @HillaryClinton - Why did five of your staffers need FBI IMMUNITY?!
We must repeal Obamacare and replace it with a much more competitive, comprehensive, affordable system..
@HillaryClinton : Bill “clarified” what he meant when calling Obamacare a “disaster”.
Actually “disaster” is pretty clear..
@HillaryClinton is NOT above the law!
@HillaryClinton - ITS CALLED EXTREME VETTING!
Hypocrite!
@HillaryClinton claims she needs a “public and a private stance” in discussions with Wall Street banks.
We're going to cut taxes BIG LEAGUE for the middle class.
She's raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes!
History lesson: There’s a big difference between Hillary Clinton and Abraham Lincoln.
Here are Hillary Clinton's "accomplishments" at the State Department.
The world is most peaceful, and most prosperous when America is strongest.
We cannot let this evil continue!
Fact: line drawn in Aug ’12.
HRC Secy of State til Feb ’13.
If @HillaryClinton is president, she’ll be all talk and nothing will get done.
We agree @POTUS- "SHE'LL (Hillary Clinton) SAY ANYTHING & CHANGE NOTHING.
This country cannot take four more years of Barack Obama!
Our country has the slowest growth since 1929.
Hypocrite: @HillaryClinton is the single biggest beneficiary of Citizens United in history, by far.
Thank you St. Louis, Missouri!
Thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night.
Very exciting!
CNN is the worst - fortunately they have bad ratings because everyone knows they are biased.
Debate polls look great - thank you!
Wow, @CNN got caught fixing their "focus group" in order to make Crooked Hillary look better.
Really pathetic and totally dishonest!
Is this really America?
Terrible!
Thank you Pennsylvania.
This is a MOVEMENT like we have never seen before!
Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!
Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.
It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.
With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!
Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary.
They come at you from all sides.
They don’t know how to win - I will teach them!
Wow.
Unbelievable.
The very foul mouthed Sen.
John McCain begged for my support during his  primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!
In Texas now, leaving soon for BIG rally in Florida!
I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks.
She is unfit to run.
Crooked's State Dept gave special attention to "Friends of Bill" after the Haiti Earthquake.
Unbelievable!
DON'T LET HER FOOL US AGAIN.
VOTER REGISTRATION DEADLINES TODAY.
Thank you Texas!
If you haven't registered to VOTE- today is your last day.
Wow, @CNN Town Hall questions were given to Crooked Hillary Clinton in advance of big debates against Bernie Sanders.
Hillary & CNN FRAUD!
Join me Thursday in Florida & Ohio!
Thank you Florida- a MOVEMENT that has never been seen before and will never be seen again.
Crooked Hillary Clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years - why didn't she do them?
Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks.
So dishonest!
Rigged system!
PAY TO PLAY POLITICS.
The people of Cuba have struggled too long.
Will reverse Obama's Executive Orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored.
The MOVEMENT in Lakeland, Florida.
Voter registration extended to 10/18.
I will be in Cincinnati, Ohio tomorrow night at 7:30pm- join me!
Why didn't the writer of the twelve year old article in People Magazine mention the "incident" in her story.
Because it did not happen!
The phony story in the failing @nytimes is a TOTAL FABRICATION.
Written by same people as last discredited story on women.
WATCH!
Join me in Ohio & Maine!
Thank you!
I am making a major speech in West Palm Beach, Florida at noon.
Tune in!
Just left a great rally in Florida - now heading to Ohio for two more.
Will be there soon.
Great event in Columbus- taking off for Cincinnati now.
Great new Ohio poll out- thank you!
Dem Gov.

Join me in Greensboro, North Carolina tomorrow at 2:00pm!

This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!
Will be in Bangor, Maine today at 3pm- join me!
Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail.
Mr. Trump removing the broken teleprompter in North Carolina-in front of a massive crowd.
The truth is a beautiful weapon.
Landing in New Hampshire soon to talk about the massive drug problem there, and all over the country.
The MOVEMENT in Portsmouth, New Hampshire w/ 7K supporters.
THANK YOU!
Nothing ever happened with any of these women.
Totally made up nonsense to steal the election.
Nobody has more respect for women than me!
The failing @nytimes reporters don't even call us anymore, they just write whatever they want to write, making up sources along the way!
Thank you Bangor, Maine!
A great day in New Hampshire and Maine.
Fantastic crowds and energy!
Thank you for sharing Amy.
Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me.
Time to retire the boring and unfunny show.
Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks.
Media rigging election!
Polls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
Media rigging election!
Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news!
They let Crooked & the Gang off the hook for the crime, but it looks like the cover-up is just as bad.
Unbelievable!
A country that Crooked Hillary says has funded ISIS also gave Wild Bill $1 million for his birthday?
SO CORRUPT!
Hillary's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over.
Who would trust these people with national security?
We've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme.
Wikileaks may have found the answer.
Obama!
Join me in Wisconsin tomorrow or Colorado on Tuesday!
The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton.
We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!
Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.
Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!
Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows "quid pro quo" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.
Such a dishonest person - & Paul Ryan does zilch!
ALL SAFE IN ORANGE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA.
With you all the way, will never forget.
Now we have to win.
Proud of you all!
Can't believe these totally phoney stories, 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press, have impact!
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day.
Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on?
So naive!
We have all got to come together and win this election.
We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse!
).
WikiLeaks proves even the Clinton campaign knew Crooked mishandled classified info, but no one gets charged?
RIGGED!
Unbelievable.
Voter fraud!
Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word.
Can you imagine if I got the questions?
CORRUPTION CONFIRMED: FBI confirms State Dept.
Wow, new polls just came out from @CNN   Great numbers, especially after total media hit job.
Leading Ohio 48 - 44.
Our thoughts are with the forces fighting ISIS in Iraq.
Crooked Hillary colluded w/FBI and DOJ and media is covering up to protect her.
Join me in Colorado Springs, Colorado tomorrow at 1:00pm!
My wife, Melania, will be interviewed tonight at 8:00pm by Anderson Cooper on @CNN.
I have no doubt she will do very well.
Enjoy!
Get rich quick!
Great night in WI.
I will Make Our Government Honest Again -- believe me.
Pay-to-play.
Collusion.
Cover-ups.
And now bribery?
So CROOKED.
If we let Crooked run the govt, history will remember 2017 as the year America lost its independence.
Nevada: A quick reminder that today is your last day to register to vote!
FL, KS, ME, MD, MN, NJ, OR & WV!
It's the LAST DAY to mail in voter reg forms.
Thank you Colorado Springs.
Hillary is the most corrupt person to ever run for the presidency of the United States.
Join me in Delaware, Ohio tomorrow at 12:30pm!

I will issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a FOREIGN GOVERNMENT!
Join my team tonight at 8:30pmE!
UNBELIEVABLE!
This is an incredible MOVEMENT- WE are going to take our country BACK!
Ready to lead.
Ready to Make America Great Again.
The 2nd Amendment is under siege.
We need SCOTUS judges who will uphold the US Constitution...
@HillaryClinton lists litany of ways she plans to restrict gun rights.
It is so imperative that we have the right justices..
Drugs are pouring into this country.
If we have no border, we have no country.
That’s why ICE endorsed me.
Hillary Clinton will use American tax dollars to provide amnesty for thousands of illegals.
One of my first acts as President will be to deport the drug lords and then secure the border.
Plain & Simple: We should only admit into this country those who share our VALUES and RESPECT our people..
@RealDonaldTrump wants a SAFE America w/ stronger borders, no amnesty, and an END to sanctuary cities.
Hillary is too weak to lead on border security-no solutions, no ideas, no credibility.
She supported NAFTA, worst deal in US history.
Moderator: Hillary paid $225,000 by a Brazilian bank for a speech that called for “open borders”.
That’s a quote!
Hey @POTUS - WE AGREE!
Hillary has called for 550% more Syrian immigrants, but won’t even mention “radical Islamic terrorists”..
@HillaryClinton- you have failed, failed, and failed.
Moderator: Hillary plan calls for more regulation and more government spending..
@HillaryClinton has been a foreign policy DISASTER for the American people..
@HillaryClinton talking about jobs?
Remember what she promised upstate New York..
@HillaryClinton's tax hikes will CRUSH our economy.
I will cut taxes -- BIG LEAGUE.
I will renegotiate NAFTA.
If I can’t make a great deal, we’re going to tear it up.
We’re going to get this economy running again.
THE CHOICE IS CLEAR!
@HillaryClinton has been doing this for THIRTY YEARS....
where has she been?
Crooked Hillary has never created a job in her life.
We will create 25 million jobs.
Think she can do that?
Our country is stagnant.
We’ve lost jobs and business..
@realDonaldTrump will do more in the first 30 days in office than Hillary has done in the last 30 years!
Brought to you by @HillaryClinton & her campaign- in Chicago, Illinois.
Crooked's camp incited violence at my rallies.
These incidents weren't "spontaneous" - like she claimed in Benghazi!
I will do more in the first 30 days in office than Hillary has done in the last 30 years!
She'll say anything and change NOTHING!
@HillaryClinton loves to lie.
America has had enough of the CLINTON'S!
Moderator: “Respectfully, you won’t answer the pay-to-play question”.
Crooked @HillaryClinton's foundation is a CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE.
LIVE FACT-CHECK: Trump's RIGHT.
The Clinton Foundation has taken MILLIONS from the Middle East.
Crooked’s top aides were MIRED in massive conflicts of interests at the State Dept.
You should give the money back @HillaryClinton!
Hillary says "take back Mosul"?
HILLARY FAILED ALL OVER THE WORLD.
Bernie Sanders on HRC: Bad Judgement.
John Podesta on HRC: Bad Instincts.
I opposed going into Iraq.
Hillary voted for it.
As with everything else she's supported, it was a DISASTER.
After Crooked @HillaryClinton allowed ISIS to rise, she now claims she'll defeat them?
LAUGHABLE!
I WILL DEFEAT ISIS.
THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND TOO LONG!
What has our leadership been doing?
USA has the greatest business people in the world but we let political hacks negotiate our deals.
We need change!
Together we can save American JOBS, American LIVES, and AMERICAN FUTURES!
The economy cannot take four more years of these same failed policies..
@realDonaldTrump is going to cut taxes BIG LEAGUE -- Crooked is going to raise taxes BIG LEAGUE!
I started this campaign to Make America Great Again.
That’s what I’m going to do.
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama and that’s what you’ll get if you vote for Hillary.
The era of division is coming to an end.
Join my team over on my Facebook page- live now!
That was really exciting.
Made all of my points.

Crooked took MILLIONS from oppressive ME countries.

When Obama took office in 2009 employer-provided premiums cost $13,375.

Gone up 12 points in two weeks, mostly before the Crooked Hillary blow-up!
Crooked Hillary should not be allowed to run for president.
She deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER getting a subpoena from U.S. Congress.
RIGGED!

The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me.
I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win.
Very nice!

Very nice!
Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win.
The people of Ohio were incredible!

Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions.
I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children.
This was a typically false news story.
The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition.
It is going so smoothly.
Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said.
Australia, New Zealand, and more.
I am always available to them.
@nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today.
I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.

I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.
This should not happen!

Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States.
He would do a great job!
I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment.
Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes.
In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high.
I can fully understand that - but why announce?
Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.
The meeting with the @nytimes is back on at 12:30 today.
Look forward to it!

Fidel Castro is dead!
The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted.
Not so anymore!
Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in.
Hillary's debate answer on delay: "That is horrifying.
That is not the way our democracy works.
Been around for 240 years.
and fair elections.
during a general election.
of position".
Then, separately she stated, "He said something truly horrifying ...
this election.
That is a direct threat to our democracy".
Trump is going to be our President.
We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead".
So much time and money will be spent - same result!

I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!

Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed!
@CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do.
The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!
I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!
Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!

I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my ...
great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
While I am not mandated to ....
do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President,  to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses..
Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations.
The Presidency is a far more important task!
Join me in Cincinnati, Ohio tomorrow evening at 7:00pm.
I am grateful for all of your support.
THANK YOU!
Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier.
They will sell many air conditioners!
My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic storms and tornadoes in the Southeastern United States.
Stay safe!
Heading to U.S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati, Ohio for a 7pm rally.
Join me!
Thank you Ohio!
Together, we made history – and now, the real work begins.
America will start winning again!
The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency.
Thank you!
Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.
Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers.
This is happening all over our country.
No more!
State Treasurer John Kennedy is my choice for US Senator from Louisiana.
Early voting today; election next Saturday.
Our great VPE, @mike_pence, is in Louisiana campaigning for John Kennedy for US Senate.
John will be a tremendous help to us in Washington.
Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable!
Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse.
fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S.  ......
without retribution or consequence, is WRONG!
There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ......
wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc.
, back across the border.
This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but.....
these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged.
Please be forewarned prior to making a very ...
expensive mistake!
The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount.
Just a Stein scam to raise money!
@FoxNews will be re-running "Objectified: Donald Trump," the ratings hit produced by the great Harvey Levin of TMZ, at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into..
their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?
I don't think so!
I am thrilled to nominate Dr. @RealBenCarson as our next Secretary of the US Dept.
If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to "tweet".
Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen!
Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.
Cancel order!
Join me tonight in Fayetteville, North Carolina at 7pm!
Masa (SoftBank) of Japan has agreed to invest $50 billion in the U.S. toward businesses and 50,000 new jobs....
Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!
Departing New York with General James 'Mad Dog' Mattis for tonight's rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina!
A great night in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
Thank you!
I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:30.
Enjoy!
We pause today to remember the 2,403 American heroes who selflessly gave their lives at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago...
Join me tomorrow in Des Moines, Iowa with Vice President-Elect @mike_pence - at 7:00pm!
Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers.
No wonder companies flee country!
If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana.
Spend more time working-less time talking.
Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn.
He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers.
He will be missed.
On my way to Des Moines, Iowa- will see you soon with @mike_pence.
Join us!
Join me tomorrow!
THANK YOU IOWA!
Join me live in Louisiana!
Tomorrow, we need you to go to the polls & send John Kennedy to the U.S. Senate.
Thank you Louisiana!
Get out & vote for John Kennedy tomorrow.
Thank you Michigan.
We are going to bring back your jobs & together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@RudyGiuliani, one of the finest people I know and a former GREAT Mayor of N.Y.C., just took himself out of consideration for "State".
I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it.
Will devote ZERO TIME!
As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today.
Looking forward to it, should be fun!
Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS!
A very interesting read.
Unfortunately, so much is true.
October 2015 - thanks Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday!
I will be interviewed today on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:00 (Eastern) Network.
ENJOY!
Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic.
There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium.
A wonderful experience, and congrats to Army!
I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U.S.Senate.
The election is over - JOHN WON!
Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker.
Stay tuned!
Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point.
Just can't get much worse, although @CNN is right up there!
Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card.
It would be called conspiracy theory!
Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking.
Why wasn't this brought up before election?
The F-35 program and cost is out of control.
Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.
The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes.
The Dems and Green Party can now rest.
Scam!
I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning.
Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the......
Presidency.
Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them.
No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.
I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest.
Busy times!
I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states.
I actually picked up additional votes!
The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.
Join me this Saturday at Ladd–Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama!
Thank you Wisconsin!
My Administration will be focused on three very important words: jobs, jobs, jobs!
@BillGates and @JimBrownNFL32 in my Trump Tower office yesterday- two great guys!
Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine.
Way down, big trouble, dead!
Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!
Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me "Person of the Year" - a great honor!
The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't!
If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?
Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?
Join me in Mobile, Alabama on Sat.
at 3pm!
Thank you Pennsylvania!
Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?
Well, we all did it, together!
I hope the "MOVEMENT" fans will go to D.C. on Jan 20th for the swearing in.
Let's set the all time record!
Thank you Florida.
My Administration will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN and HIRE AMERICAN!
Last night in Orlando, Florida, was incredible - massive crowd - THANK YOU FLORIDA!
Today at 3:00 P.M. I will be in Alabama for last rally!
Mobile, Alabama today at 3:00 P.M. Last rally of the year - "THANK YOU ALABAMA AND THE SOUTH" Biggest of all crowds expected, see you there!
China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act.
Thank you Alabama!
We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.
- let them keep it!
If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!
Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse.
The civilized world must change thinking!
We did it!
Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).
Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election.
Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations).
He "doesn't know much" ...
especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more).
Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting.
We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY!
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote.
Hillary focused on the wrong states!
I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!
I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today, talking about airplane capability and pricing.
Very impressive people!
The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed....
Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase "DRAIN THE SWAMP" was no longer being used by me.
Actually, we will always be trying to DTS.
Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!
The so-called "A" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING.
I want the PEOPLE!
My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with...
my presidency.
Isn't this a ridiculous shame?
He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop.
Wrong answer!
As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan.
The terrorist who killed so many people in Germany said just before crime, "by God's will we will slaughter you pigs, I swear, we will......
slaughter you.
This is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality.
Such hatred!
When will the U.S., and all countries, fight back?
Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion, it is humiliating.
One must be able to lose with dignity".
So true!
@NBCNews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: "until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes".
Dishonest!
The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.
Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!
@FoxNews - "Objectified" tonight at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Merry Christmas and a very, very, very , very Happy New Year to everyone!
President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me.
He should say that but I say NO WAY!
- jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.
The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.
So sad!
The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope.
Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!
I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report!
The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses.
President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost.
The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS!
Thanks Donald!
Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.
Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!
We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.
They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but.......
not anymore.
The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)!
Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!
Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!
Russians are playing @CNN and @NBCNews for such fools - funny to watch, they don't have a clue!
@FoxNews totally gets it!
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do.
Love!
Happy Birthday @DonaldJTrumpJr!
Well, the New Year begins.
We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016.
If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help!
Various media outlets and pundits say that I thought I was going to lose the election.
Wrong, it all came together in the last week and.....
I thought and felt I would win big, easily over the fabled 270 (306).
North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S.
It won't happen!
China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea.
Nice!
General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.
Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!
People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona).
The Democrat Governor.
of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable"!
- And, it is lousy healthcare.........
may be, their number one act and priority.
Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!
Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.
There should be no further releases from Gitmo.
These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.
I will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C. Thank you.
The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case.
Very strange!
Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless?
Also said Russians did not give him the info!
Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S.
Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have "hacking defense" like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible......
things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H).
A total double standard!
Media, as usual, gave them a pass.
Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases......
like the 116% hike in Arizona.
Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless.
Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web...
massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess.
It will fall of its own weight - be careful!
Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.
The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in.
Instead of working to fix it, they.....
do the typical political thing and BLAME.
The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning".
Keep you doctor, keep your plan"!
It is ime for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & FAR BETTER!
The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong.
I simply state what he states, it is for the people....
to make up their own minds as to the truth.
The media lies to make it look like I am against "Intelligence" when in fact I am a big fan!
Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY!
Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.
How did NBC get "an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented"?
Who gave them this report and why?
Politics!
The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia......
So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers?
What is going on?
The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!
Hillary and the Dems were never going to beat the PASSION of my voters.
They saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the......
and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute.
Hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will go to D.C. on January 20th.
It will be a GREAT SHOW!
Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got "swamped" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT.
So much for....
being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14.
Now compare him to my season 1.
Anna Wintour came to my office at Trump Tower to ask me to meet with the editors of Conde Nast & Steven Newhouse, a friend.
Will go this AM.
I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.
Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida.
Just spoke to Governor Scott.
Thoughts and prayers for all.
Stay safe!
Happy Birthday @EricTrump!
Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.
The Republican National Committee had strong defense!
Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results.
Voting machines not touched!
Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!
Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.
Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad!
We.....
have enough problems around the world without yet another one.
When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and....
both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!
Congratulation to Jane Timken on her major upset victory in becoming the Ohio Republican Party Chair.
I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring.
Britain, a longtime U.S. ally, is very special!
Kellyanne Conway went to @MeetThePress this morning for an interview with @chucktodd.
Dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes.
Terrible!
Before I, or anyone, saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report, it was leaked out to @NBCNews.
So serious!
Dishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly.
Media is fake!
Rupert Murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer!
Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes.
She is a.....
Hillary flunky who lost big.
For the 100th time, I never "mocked" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him.......
It's finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs.
This after...
Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico.
Thank you Ford & Fiat C!
An old picture with Nancy and Ronald Reagan.
Thank you to all of the men and women who protect & serve our communities 24/7/365!
'Trump Helps Lift Small Business Confidence to 12-Yr.
FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!
Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is "A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE".
Very unfair!
Russia has never tried to use leverage over me.
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!
I win an election easily, a great "movement" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS.
A sorry state!
Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to "leak" into the public.
One last shot at me.
Are we living in Nazi Germany?
We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today.
James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.
Made up, phony facts.
Too bad!
Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage.
People will support you even more now.
Buy L.L.Bean..
@CNN is in a total meltdown with their FAKE NEWS because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone!
All of my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job.
I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!
It now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued....
Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans - FAKE NEWS!
Russia says nothing exists.
Probably...
released by "Intelligence" even knowing there is no proof, and never will be.
My people will have a full report on hacking within 90 days!
What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had she should never.....
have been allowed to run - guilty as hell.
They were VERY nice to her.
She lost because she campaigned in the wrong states - no enthusiasm!
The "Unaffordable" Care Act will soon be history!
A beautiful funeral today for a real NYC hero, Detective Steven McDonald.
Our law enforcement community has my complete and total support.
Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to......
mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.
All talk, talk, talk - no action or results.
Sad!
INTELLIGENCE INSIDERS NOW CLAIM THE TRUMP DOSSIER IS "A COMPLETE FRAUD"!
Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!
Inauguration Day is turning out to be even bigger than expected.
January 20th, Washington D.C. Have fun!
The Democrats are most angry that so many Obama Democrats voted for me.
With all of the jobs I am bringing back to our Nation, that number..
will only get higher.
Car companies and others, if they want to do business in our country, have to start making things here again.
WIN!
For many years our country has been divided, angry and untrusting.
Many say it will never change, the hatred is too deep.
IT WILL CHANGE!!!!
Thank you to Bob Woodward who said, "That is a garbage document...
it never should have been presented...
Trump's right to be upset (angry)...
about that...
Those Intelligence chiefs made a mistake here, & when people make mistakes, they should APOLOGIZE"..
@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC.
Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job.
Really bad television!
@FoxNews "Outgoing CIA Chief, John Brennan, blasts Pres-Elect Trump on Russia threat.
Does not fully understand".
Oh really, couldn't do...
much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes.
Not good!
Was this the leaker of Fake News?
Celebrate Martin Luther King Day and all of the many wonderful things that he stood for.
Honor him for being the great man that he was!
At 9:00 P.M. @CNN, of all places, is doing a Special Report on my daughter, Ivanka.
Considering it is CNN, can't imagine it will be great!
People are pouring into Washington in record numbers.
Bikers for Trump are on their way.
It will be a great Thursday, Friday and Saturday!
The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls.
They are rigged just like before.
With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S. (even before taking office), with all of the new auto plants coming back into our.....
country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing "big stuff".
John Lewis said about my inauguration, "It will be the first one that I've missed".
WRONG (or lie)!
He boycotted Bush 43 also because he...
Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!
Will be interviewed by @ainsleyearhardt on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!
Totally biased @NBCNews went out of its way to say that the big announcement from Ford, G.M., Lockheed & others that jobs are coming back...
to the U.S., but had nothing to do with TRUMP, is more FAKE NEWS.
Ask top CEO's of those companies for real facts.
Came back because of me!
No wonder the Today Show on biased @NBC is doing so badly compared to its glorious past.
Little credibility!
@TheAlabamaBand was great last night in D.C. playing for 147 Diplomats and Ambassadors from countries around the world.
Thanks Alabama!
Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, three weeks ago.
Looking forward to Friday.
Looking forward to a speedy recovery for George and Barbara Bush, both hospitalized.
Thank you for your wonderful letter!
Great seeing @TheLeeGreenwood  and Kimberly at this evenings VP dinner!
Thank you to our amazing Wounded Warriors for their service.
Getting ready to leave for Washington, D.C. The journey begins and I will be working and fighting very hard to make it a great journey for..
the American people.
I have no doubt that we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
On my way!
Great Concert at 4:00 P.M. today at Lincoln Memorial.
Enjoy!
Join me at 4pm over at the Lincoln Memorial with my family!
Thank you for joining us at the Lincoln Memorial tonight- a very special evening!
It all begins today!
I will see you at 11:00 A.M. for the swearing-in.
THE MOVEMENT CONTINUES - THE WORK BEGINS!
Today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring...
power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.
What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.
January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
We will bring back our jobs.
We will bring back our borders.
We will bring back our wealth - and we will bring back our dreams!
We will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN & HIRE AMERICAN!
It is time to remember that...
So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain...
A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!
Had a great meeting at CIA Headquarters yesterday, packed house, paid great respect to Wall, long standing ovations, amazing people.
WIN!
Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election!
Why didn't these people vote?
Celebs hurt cause badly.
Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!
Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy.
Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.
Busy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security.
Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.
Will be meeting at 9:00 with top automobile executives concerning jobs in America.
I want new plants to be built here for cars sold here!
A photo delivered yesterday that will be displayed in the upper/lower press hall.
Thank you Abbas!
Great meeting with automobile industry leaders at the @WhiteHouse this morning.
Great meeting with Ford CEO Mark Fields and General Motors CEO Mary Barra at the @WhiteHouse today.
Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings.
They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN - public is smart!
If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible "carnage" going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!
Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow.
Among many other things, we will build the wall!
I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....
even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time).
Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!
I will be making my Supreme Court pick on Thursday of next week.
Thank you!
I will be interviewed by @DavidMuir tonight at 10 o'clock on @ABC.
Will be my first interview from the White House.
Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders.
As your President, I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people.
Interview with David Muir of @ABC News in 10 minutes.
Enjoy!
Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader.
Terrible!
The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico.
It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers...
of jobs and companies lost.
If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.
Spoke at the Congressional @GOP Retreat in Philadelphia, PA.
this afternoon w/ @VP, @SenMajLeader, @SpeakerRyan.
Spoke at the Congressional @GOP Retreat in Philadelphia, PA.
this afternoon w/ @VP, @SenateMajLdr, @SpeakerRyan.
Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity on @FoxNews at 10:00pm tonight.
Enjoy!
Miami-Dade Mayor drops sanctuary policy.
Right decision.
Strong!
Look forward to seeing final results of VoteStand.
Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal.
We must do better!
Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for long enough.
Massive trade deficits & little help on the very weak border must change, NOW!
Congratulations Secretary Mattis!
I promise that our administration will ALWAYS have your back.
We will ALWAYS be with you!
The failing @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning.
Said I would lose the primaries, then the general election.
FAKE NEWS!
Thr coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its indling subscribers and readers.
They got me wrong right from the beginning and still have not changed course, and never will.
Today, we remember the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger, 31 years later.
I will be interviewed by @TheBrodyFile on @CBNNews tonight at 11pm.
Enjoy!
Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!
Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW.
Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!
Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers.
We cannot allow this horror to continue!
The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong - they are sadly weak on immigration.
The two Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.
I will be interviewed by @TheBrodyFile on @CBNNews tonight at 11pm.
Enjoy!
Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning.
Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,.....
protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer.
Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems.
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country.
This was a big part of my campaign.
Study the world!
If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the "bad" would rush into our country during that week.
A lot of bad "dudes" out there!
I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court.
Where was all the outrage from Democrats and the opposition party (the media) when our jobs were fleeing our country?
The American dream is back.
The Democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons.
They have nothing going but to obstruct.
Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally  at the steps of The Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!
When will the Democrats give us our Attorney General and rest of Cabinet!
They should be ashamed of themselves!
No wonder D.C. doesn't work!
Getting ready to deliver a VERY IMPORTANT DECISION!
Join me live from the @WhiteHouse.
Hope you like my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court.
He is a good and brilliant man, respected by all.
Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN.
Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!
Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there.
Obvious long ago!
Do you believe it?
The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia.
Why?
I will study this dumb deal!
If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?
Congratulations to Rex Tillerson on being sworn in as our new Secretary of State.
He will be a star!
Attending Chief Ryan Owens' Dignified Transfer yesterday with my daughter Ivanka was my great honor.
To a great and brave man - thank you!
Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.
Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!
Thank you, @Samsung!
We would love to have you!
Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...
but at least he tried hard!
Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them.
Not me!
Thank you to Prime Minister of Australia for telling the truth about our very civil conversation that FAKE NEWS media lied about.
Very nice!
Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning.
Good jobs are coming back to U.S., health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!
Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris.
Tourists were locked down.
France on edge again.
We must keep "evil" out of our country!
Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.
We should charge them SAME as they charge us!
When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.
security - big trouble!
Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban.
They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?
Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country.
Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
Interview with @oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4:00 P.M. (prior to Super Bowl).
Enjoy!
The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart.
Bad people are very happy!
Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril.
If something happens blame him and court system.
People pouring in.
Bad!
I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY.
The courts are making the job very difficult!
What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots.
Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners.
Wow!
Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election.
Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.
I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it.
Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!
The failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me.
They have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!
An extended interview from the Super Bowl with @oreillyfactor airs tonight at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
The failing @nytimes was forced to apologize to its subscribers for the poor reporting it did on my election win.
Now they are worse!
The threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real, just look at what is happening in Europe and the Middle-East.
Courts must act fast!
An honor having the National Sheriffs' Assoc.
join me at the @WhiteHouse.
It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country.
Obstruction by Democrats!
If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled.
Politics!
I will be speaking at 9:00 A.M. today to Police Chiefs and Sheriffs and will be discussing the horrible, dangerous and wrong decision.......
Thank you to our great Police Chiefs & Sheriffs for your leadership & service.
My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.
She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing!
Terrible!
Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D!
Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel.
A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS!
'Majority in Leading EU Nations Support Trump-Style Travel Ban'  Poll of more than 10,000 people in 10 countries...
Congratulations to our new Attorney General, @SenatorSessions!
Sen.
Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?
Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen.
Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave "service" in Vietnam.
FAKE NEWS!
Sen.
McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media.
Only emboldens the enemy!
He's been losing so ong he doesn't know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in - bogged down in conflict all over the place.
Our hero....
Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a "failure".
Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again!
Join us live in the Oval Office for the swearing in of our new Attorney General, @SenatorSessions!
SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!
LAWFARE: "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute".
A disgraceful decision!
The failing @nytimes does major FAKE NEWS China story saying "Mr.Xi has not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov.
We spoke at length yesterday!
Our legal system is broken!
"77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries".
(WT)  SO DANGEROUS!
I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the sign or negotiations yet.
When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN!
Melania and I are hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mrs. Abe at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.
They are a wonderful couple!
Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States!
I am so proud of my daughter Ivanka.
To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful!
Playef golf today with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and @TheBig_Easy, Ernie Els, and had a great time.
Japan is very well represented!
Played golf today with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and @TheBig_Easy, Ernie Els, and had a great time.
Japan is very well represented!
A working dinner tonight with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and his representatives, at the Winter White House (Mar-a-Lago).
Very good talks!
The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise.
Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!
While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network.
They said technical difficulties!
After two days of very productive talks, Prime Minister Abe is heading back to Japan.
I know Mark Cuban well.
He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.
He's not smart enough to run for president!
Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows.
Great job!
Just leaving Florida.
Big crowds of enthusiastic supporters lining the road that the FAKE NEWS media refuses to mention.
Very dishonest!
Today I will meet with Canadian PM Trudeau and a group of leading business women to discuss women in the workforce.
Welcome to the @WhiteHouse Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau!
Congratulations Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin!
The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?
Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?
Great parent-teacher listening session this morning with @VP Pence & @usedgov Secretary @BetsyDeVos.
Obamacare continues to fail.
Humana to pull out in 2018.
Will repeal, replace & save healthcare for ALL Americans.
The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred.
@MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable.
@foxandfriends is great!
This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?
).
Thank you to Eli Lake of The Bloomberg View - "The NSA & FBI...
should not interfere in our politics...
Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration.
Was Obama too soft on Russia?
The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy.
Very un-American!
Great listening session with CEO's of the Retail Industry Leaders Association this morning!
Welcome to the United States, @IsraeliPM Benjamin & Sara!
Join me in Florida this Saturday at 5pm for a rally at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport!
Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades.
Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!
Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years.
Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!
The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers!
They will be caught!
FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!
The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA.
Fake news!
Despite the long delays by the Democrats in finally approving Dr. Tom Price, the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is moving fast!
Going to Charleston, South Carolina, in order to spend time with Boeing and talk jobs!
Look forward to it.
Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday.
Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever.
Fake media not happy!
General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others.
The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @CNN, @NBCNews and many more)    is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people.
SICK!
The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!
Looking forward to the Florida rally tomorrow.
Big crowd expected!
Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.
The White House is running VERY WELL.
I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.
Will be having many meetings this weekend at The Southern White House.
Big 5:00 P.M. speech in Melbourne, Florida.
A lot to talk about!
Getting ready to leave for Melbourne, Florida.
See you all soon!
My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.
Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully.
NOT!
HAPPY PRESIDENTS DAY - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Meeting with Generals at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.
Very interesting!
Just named General H.R. McMaster National Security Advisor.
Congratulations to our new National Security Advisor, General H.R. McMaster.
The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists.
Sad!
One thing I will say about Rep.
Keith Ellison, in his fight to lead the DNC, is that he was the one who predicted early that I would win!
Very much enjoyed my tour of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture...
A great job done by amazing people!
Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago.
What is going on there - totally out of control.
Chicago needs help!
Big interview tonight by Henry Kravis at The Business Council of Washington.
Looking forward to it!
The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government for a long time.
They can't even......
find the leakers within the FBI itself.
Going to CPAC!
FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn't tell the truth.
A great danger to our country.
The failing @nytimes has become a joke.
Likewise @CNN.
Sad!
Maybe the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN should have their own rally.
It would be the biggest of them all!
The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.
Great optimism for future of U.S. business, AND JOBS, with the DOW having an 11th straight record close.
Big tax & regulation cuts coming!
I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year.
Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!
Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC.
I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!
The race for DNC Chairman was, of course, totally "rigged".
Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance.
Clinton demanded Perez!
For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation.
Try reporting accurately & fairly!
Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!
Big dinner with Governors tonight at White House.
Much to be discussed, including healthcare.
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 6:00 A.M. Enjoy!
THANK YOU!
Since November 8th, Election Day, the Stock Market has posted $3.2 trillion in GAINS and consumer confidence is at a 15 year high.
Jobs!
Jeff Sessions is an honest man.
He did not say anything wrong.
He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not ntentional.
This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed  win.
The Democrats are overplaying their hand.
They lost the election, and now they have lost their grip on reality.
The real story is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information.
It is a total "witch hunt"!
Nick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read.
The merit-based system is the way to go.
Canada, Australia!
It is so pathetic that the Dems have still not approved my full Cabinet.
We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin.
A total hypocrite!
I hear by demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it.
We must fix our education system for our kids to Make America Great Again.
Wonderful day at Saint Andrew in Orlando.
I hearby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it.
I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs......
Terrible!
Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory.
Nothing found.
This is McCarthyism!
Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.
Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election?
Turned down by court earlier.
A NEW LOW!
I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!
How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process.
This is Nixon/Watergate.
Bad (or sick) guy!
Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't voluntarily leaving the Apprentice, he was fired by his bad (pathetic) ratings, not by me.
Is it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked?
Can that be possible?
Who was it that secretly said to Russian President, "Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll have more flexibility"?
Thank you for the great rallies all across the country.
Tremendous support.
Make America Great Again!
Buy American & hire American are the principals at the core of my agenda, which is: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Thank you @exxonmobil.
$20 billion investment.
We are already winning again, America!
There is an incredible spirit of optimism sweeping the country right now—we're bringing back the JOBS!
Buy American & hire American are the principles at the core of my agenda, which is: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Thank you @exxonmobil.
Thank you to @exxonmobil for your $20 billion investment that is creating more than 45,000 manufacturing & construction jobs in the USA!
Just another terrible decision!
Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation.
ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!
For eight years Russia "ran over" President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea and added missiles.
Weak!
Don't worry, getting rid of state lines, which will promote competition, will be in phase 2 & 3 of healthcare rollout.
I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry.
Pricing for the American people will come way down!
Don't let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infighting in the Trump Admin.
We are getting along great, and getting major things done!
I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!
I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy.
On International Women's Day, join me in honoring the critical role of women here in America & around the world.
Met with @RepCummings today at the @WhiteHouse.
Great discussion!
Great news.
We are only just beginning.
Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great.
We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
Honored to meet this years @SenateYouth delegates w/ @VP Pence in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse.
Weekly Address - 11:00 A.M. at the @WhiteHouse!
We are making great progress with healthcare.
ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse.
Republicans coming together to get job done!
It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives.
Be nice, you will do much better!
ObamaCare is imploding.
It is a disaster and 2017 will be the worst year yet, by far!
Republicans will come together and save the day.
Healthcare listening session w/ @VP & @SecPriceMD.
Proud to welcome our great Cabinet this afternoon for our first meeting.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Great optimism in America – and the results will be even better!
Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, "went to his mailbox" and found my tax returns?
@NBCNews  FAKE NEWS!
Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama?
Jail time!
Will be going to Detroit, Michigan (love), today for a big meeting on bringing back car production to State & U.S. Already happening!
Looking forward to a big rally in Nashville, Tennessee, tonight.
Big crowd of great people expected.
Will be fun!
CEO's most optimistic since 2009.
It will only get better as we continue to slash unnecessary regulations and when we begin our big tax cut!
I will be interviewed by @TuckerCarlson tonight at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews.
Enjoy!
Thank you Andrew Jackson!
In Nashville, Tennessee!
Lets MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thank you Nashville, Tennessee!
An honor to welcome the Taoiseach of Ireland, @EndaKennyTD to the @WhiteHouse today with @VP Pence.
Great progress on healthcare.
Improvements being made - Republicans coming together!
My representatives had a great meeting w/ the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce at the WH today.
Look forward to tremendous growth & future mtgs!
Happy Lá Fheile Phadraig to all of my great Irish friends!
North Korea is behaving very badly.
They have been "playing" the United States for years.
China has done little to help!
Great meeting with the @RepublicanStudy Committee this morning at the @WhiteHouse!
Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Nevertheless, Germany owes st sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!
James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia.
This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!
The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign.
Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!
The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information.
Must find leaker now!
Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster.
What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians?
Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?
Congratulations Eric & Lara.
Very proud and happy for the two of you!
Thank you Louisville, Kentucky- on my way!
Thank you Louisville, Kentucky.
Together, we will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
Joined the @HouseGOP Conference this morning at the U.S. Capitol.
Honored to sign S.442 today.
Big day for healthcare.
Working hard!
Spoke to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May today to offer condolences on the terrorist attack in London.
She is strong and doing very well.
Just watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC.
Such dishonesty!
A great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the London terror attack.
My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.
It was an honor to welcome so many truckers and trucking industry leaders to the @WhiteHouse today!
After seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums & deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan!
The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!
Today, I was thrilled to announce a commitment of $25 BILLION & 20K AMERICAN JOBS over the next 4 years.
ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE.
Do not worry!
Thanks you for all of the Trump Rallies today.
Amazing support.
We will all MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!
General Kelly is doing a great job at the border.
Numbers are way down.
Many are not even trying to come in anymore.
Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech oney to Bill, the Hillary Russian "reset," praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company.
Trump Russia story is a hoax.
The Republican House Freedom Caucus was able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
After so many bad years they were ready for a win!
The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long.
Do not worry, we are in very  good shape!
Big announcement by Ford today.
Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants.
Car companies coming back to U.S.  JOBS!
JOBS!
JOBS!
Watch @foxandfriends now on Podesta and Russia!
The failing @NYTimes would do much better if they were honest!
It was an honor to welcome @GLFOP to the @WhiteHouse today with @VP Pence & Attorney General Sessions.
A NEW ERA IN AMERICAN ENERGY!
Why doesn't Fake News talk about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia to Clinton - sale of  Uranium?
Remember when the failing @nytimes apologized to its subscribers, right after the election, because their coverage was so wrong.
Now worse!
If the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media!
Today's EO established a commission on combating drug addiction and the opioid crisis..
@FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to stop by the Women's Empowerment  Panel this afternoon at the @WhiteHouse.
Today we honored our true American heroes on the first-ever National Vietnam War Veterans Day.
The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast.
We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!
The failing @nytimes has disgraced the media world.
Gotten me wrong for two solid years.
Change libel laws?
Great op-ed from @RepKenBuck.
If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform.
If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform.
Where are @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador?
The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits and job losses.
American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.
Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!
Great meeting with a wonderful woman today, former Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice!
It is an exciting time for our country!
We are going to defend our industry & create a level playing field for the American worker.
When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?
It is the same Fake News Media that said there is "no path to victory for Trump" that is now pushing the phony Russia story.
A total scam!
The failing @nytimes finally gets it - "In places where no insurance company offers plans, there will be no way for ObamaCare customers to.....
use subsidies to buy health plans".
In other words, Ocare is dead.
Good things will happen, however, either with Republicans or Dems.
Wow, @FoxNews just reporting big news.
Source: "Official behind unmasking is high up.
Known Intel official is responsible.
Some unmasked......
not associated with Russia.
Trump team spied on before he was nominated".
If this is true, does not get much bigger.
Anybody (especially  Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal & Replace of ObamaCare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party!
Talks on Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.
The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING!
Find the leakers.
Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends.
"Spied on before nomination".
The real story.
Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted?
Did Hillary know?
Did Hillary Clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate?
Just asking!
@FoxNews from multiple sources: "There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump.
This is unprecedented".
Getting ready to meet President al-Sisi of Egypt.
On behalf of the United States, I look forward to a long and wonderful relationship..
Thank you Sean McGarvey & the entire Governing Board of Presidents for honoring me w/an invite to speak.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
It was a great honor to have President Xi Jinping and Madame Peng Liyuan of China as our guests in the United States.
Tremendous goodwill and friendship was formed, but only time will tell on trade.
Congratulations to our great military men and women for representing the United States, and the world, so well in the Syria attack.
The reason you don't generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!
Judge Gorsuch will be sworn in at the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday at 11:00 A.M.
He will be a great Justice.
Very proud of him!
So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt.
U.S. strongly condemns.
I have great confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly.
Thank you @USNavy!
Congratulations to Justice Neil Gorsuch on his elevation to the United States Supreme Court.
Happy Passover to everyone celebrating in the United States of America, Israel, and around the world.
I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!
North Korea is looking for trouble.
If China decides to help, that would be great.
If not, we will solve the problem without them!
Ron Estes is running TODAY for Congress in the Great State of Kansas.
A wonderful guy, I need his help on Healthcare & Tax Cuts (Reform).
Great Strategic & Policy CEO Forum today with my Cabinet Secretaries and top CEO's from around the United States.
I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 6:00 A.M. @FoxBusiness.
Enjoy!
Had a very good call last night with the President of China concerning the menace of North Korea.
Great win in Kansas last night for Ron Estes, easily winning the Congressional race against the Dems, who spent heavily & predicted victory!
Great meeting w/ NATO Sec.
Gen.
Economic confidence is soaring as we unleash the power of private sector job creation and stand up for the American Workers.
One by one we are keeping our promises - on the border, on energy, on jobs, on regulations.
Big changes are happening!
Jobs are returning, illegal immigration is plummeting, law, order and justice are being restored.
We are truly making America great again!
I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea.
If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will!
Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia.
At the right time everyone will come to their senses & there will be lasting peace!
It was a great honor to welcome Atlanta's heroic first responders to the White House this afternoon!
Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem?
We will see what happens!
Happy Easter to everyone!
I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College!
Now Tax Returns are brought up again?
Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday.
The election is over!
Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before.
Frankly, we have no choice!
The recent Kansas election (Congress) was a really big media event, until the Republicans won.
Now they play the same game with Georgia-BAD!
A great book for your reading enjoyment: "REASONS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS" by Michael J. Knowles.
The Fake Media (not Real Media) has gotten even worse since the election.
Every story is badly slanted.
We have to hold them to the truth!
The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!
See you tomorrow Wisconsin!
With eleven Republican candidates running in Georgia (on Tuesday) for Congress, a runoff will be a win.
Vote "R" for lower taxes & safety!
The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin.
allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S.
We are removing them fast!
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends by @ainsleyearhardt starting at 6:00 A.M. Enjoy!
Democrat Jon Ossoff would be a disaster in Congress.
VERY weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes.
Republicans must get out today and VOTE in Georgia 6.
Force runoff and easy win!
Just learned that Jon @Ossoff, who is running for Congress in Georgia, doesn't even live in the district.
Republicans, get out and vote!
Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG "R" win with runoff in Georgia.
Glad to be of help!
Dems failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia.
Great job Karen Handel!
It is now Hollywood vs.
Georgia on June 20th.
Today I signed the Veterans (OUR HEROES) Choice Program Extension & Improvement Act @ the @WhiteHouse.
A great honor to host the @SuperBowl Champion New England @Patriots at the White House today.
Congratulations!
We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals.
A great honor to host PM Paolo Gentiloni of Italy at the White House this afternoon!
Another terrorist attack in Paris.
The people of France will not take much more of this.
Will have a big effect on presidential election!
No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!
WELCOME HOME, AYA!
Getting ready to visit Walter Reed Medical Center with Melania.
Looking forward to seeing our bravest and greatest Americans!
Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania.
Look forward to it!
Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday.
Today on Earth Day, we celebrate our beautiful forests, lakes and land.
We stand committed to preserving the natural beauty of our nation.
I am committed to keeping our air and water clean but always remember that economic growth enhances environmental protection.
Jobs matter!
Very interesting election currently taking place in France.
Thank you Lake Worth, Florida.
ObamaCare is in serious trouble.
The Dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.
The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.
Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.
New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative.
Would still beat Hillary in  pular vote.
ABC News/Washington Post Poll (wrong big on election) said almost all stand by their vote on me & 53% said strong leader.
The two fake news polls released yesterday, ABC & NBC, while containing some very positive info, were totally wrong in General E. Watch!
The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)!
the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be!
If our healthcare plan is approved, you will see real healthcare and premiums will start tumbling down.
ObamaCare is in a death spiral!
Proud of @IvankaTrump for her leadership on these important issues.
Looking forward to hearing her speak at the W20!
Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult.
We will not stand for this.
Watch!
Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL.
It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.
Remarks at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's National Days of Remembrance.
First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings.
See you in the Supreme Court!
Out of our very big country, with many choices, does everyone notice that both the "ban" case and now the "sanctuary" case is brought in  the Ninth Circuit, which has a terrible record of being overturned (close to 80%).
They used to call this "judge shopping"!
Messy system.
The U.S. recorded its slowest economic growth in five years (2016).
GDP up only 1.6%.
Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our @FLOTUS, Melania!
Today, I signed an Executive Order @ the U.S. Dept.
Today, I signed an Executive Order on Enforcing Statutory Prohibitions on Federal Control of Education.
I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate.
I agreed.....
subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA.
Relationships are good-deal very possible!
The Democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure.
NO!
I want to help our miners while the Democrats are blocking their healthcare.
I promise to rebuild our military and secure our border.
Democrats want to shut down the government.
Politics!
What's more important?
Rebuilding our military - or bailing out insurance companies?
Ask the Democrats.
Democrats jeopardizing the safety of our troops to bail out their donors from insurance companies.
Democrats used to support border security — now they want illegals to pour through our borders.
As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks - Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government.
Terrible!
We are making tremendous progress with the V. A. There has never been so much done so quickly, and we have just started.
We love our VETS!
I will be interviewed by @MarthaMaccallum on @FoxNews tonight at 7pm.
Enjoy!
North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today.
Bad!
@LouDobbs just stated that "President Trump's successes are unmatched in recent presidential history"  Thank you Lou!
Looking forward to RALLY in the Great State of Pennsylvania tonight at 7:30.
Big crowd, big energy!
Mainstream (FAKE) media refuses to state our long list of achievements, including 28 legislative signings, strong borders & great optimism!
I will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation this morning at 10:00 A.M. Have a great day!
Big excitement last night in the Great State of Pennsylvania!
Fantastic crowd and people.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Democrats, without a leader, have become the party of obstruction.
You can't compare anything to ObamaCare because ObamaCare is dead.
Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors.......
healthcare plan is on its way.
Will have much lower premiums & deductibles while at the same time taking care of pre-existing conditions!
This month we celebrate the contributions of Asian Americans & Pacific Islanders that enrich our Nation.
President Andrew Jackson, who died 16 years before the Civil War started, saw it coming and was angry.
Would never have let it happen!
The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there!
We....
either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%.
Our country needs a good "shutdown" in September to fix mess!
Congratulations to the winners of the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, the great Air Force Falcons!
FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!
The phony Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election.
Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?
An honor to host President Mahmoud Abbas at the WH today.
Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor to President Obama, is refusing to testify before a Senate Subcommittee next week on legations of unmasking Trump transition officials.
Not good!
The Fake News media is officially out of control.
They will do or say anything in order to get attention - never been a time like this!
Congratulations to @foxandfriends on its unbelievable ratings hike.
Death spiral!
Beautiful evening with Religious Leaders here at the WH last night.
I am watching the Democrats trying to defend the "you can keep you doctor, you can keep your plan & premiums will go down" ObamaCare lie".
Insurance companies are fleeing ObamaCare - it is dead.
Our healthcare plan will lower premiums & deductibles - and be great healthcare!
If victorious, Republicans will be having a big press conference at the beautiful Rose Garden of the White House immediately after vote!
It was a GREAT day for the United States of America!
This is a great plan that is a repeal & replace of ObamaCare.
Big win in the House - very exciting!
But when everything comes together with the inclusion of Phase 2, we will have truly great healthcare!
Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C., I will be working out of my home in Bedminster, N.J. this weekend.
Also saves country money!
Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do --everybody does.
ObamaCare is dead!
But our healthcare will soon be great.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Wow,the Fake News media did everything in its power to make the Republican Healthcare victory look as bad as possible.
Far better than Ocare!
Why is it that the Fake News rarely reports Ocare is on its last legs and that insurance companies are fleeing for their lives?
It's dead!
Great jobs report today - It is all beginning to work!
The reason I am staying in Bedminster, N. J., a beautiful community, is that staying in NYC is much more expensive and disruptive.
Meetings!
When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?
Republican Senators will not let the American people down!
ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up - it was a lie and it is dead!
Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France.
I look very much forward to working with him!
Rexnord of Indiana made a deal during the Obama Administration to move to Mexico.
Fired their employees.
Congratulations to @PGA_JohnDaly on his big win yesterday.
John is a great guy who never gave up - and now a winner again!
General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.
Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council.
Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel.
Honored to welcome Georgia Prime Minister, Giorgi Kvirikashvili to the @WhiteHouse today with @VP Mike Pence.
Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is "no evidence" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.
Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news!
The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?
Biggest story today between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance.
Why doesn't the media report on this?
It was an honor to welcome the Teachers of the Year to the WH last month.
Today, we honor and thank all teachers!
Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, "I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer".
Then acts so indignant.
The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!
James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.
Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike.
When things calm down, they will be thanking me!
Watching Senator Richard Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke.
"Richie" devised one of the greatest military frauds in U.S. history.
For....
years, as a pol in Connecticut, Blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in Vietnam - except he was never there.
When....
caught, he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness...
and now he is judge & jury.
He should be the one who is investigated for his acts.
The Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News.
Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision.
Dems have been complaining for months & months about Dir.
Comey.
Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved.
Phony hypocrites!
The Democrats should be ashamed.
This is a disgrace!
We finally agree on something Rosie.
Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.
Again, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.
The Fake Media is working overtime today!
As a very active President with lots of things happening, it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy!
aybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future "press briefings" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???
James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
When James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?
China just agreed that the U.S. will be allowed to sell beef, and other major products, into China once again.
This is REAL news!
Today, @FLOTUS hosted a Military Mother's Day Event in the East Room of the WH.
Today, I welcomed the Victory Christian Center School.
Good luck @ the Team America Rocketry Challenge!
Will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at 9:00 P.M. (Saturday night).
Enjoy!
I was thrilled to be back @LibertyU.
Congratulations to the Class of 2017!
This is your day, and you've earned it.
Wishing @FLOTUS Melania and all of the great mothers out there a wonderful day ahead with family and friends!
Today, I delivered remarks at the 36th Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service.
As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining o terrorism and airline flight safety.
Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.
I have been asking Director Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....
With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel appointed!
This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!
With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!
A great honor to welcome President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia to the White House today!
Getting ready for my big foreign trip.
Will be strongly protecting American interests - that's what I like to do!
Great to be in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Looking forward to the afternoon and evening ahead.
We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom.
Thank you for such a wonderful and unforgettable visit, Prime Minister @Netanyahu and @PresidentRuvi.
Israel, Saudi Arabia and the Middle East were great.
Trying hard for PEACE.
Doing well.
All civilized nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right of our citizens to live in safety and in peace.
Honor of a lifetime to meet His Holiness Pope Francis.
Thank you for the warm welcome to Brussels, Belgium this afternoon!
Today's ceremony is a day for both remembrance and resolve.
Thank you for your support.
Together, we will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!
Just arrived in Taormina with @FLOTUS Melania.
Just arrived in Italy for the G7.
Trip has been very successful.
We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs.
Getting ready to engage G7 leaders on many issues including economic growth, terrorism, and security.
On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and myself, thank you for a wonderful dinner and evening, President Sergio Mattarella.
Big G7 meetings today.
Lots of very important matters under discussion.
First on the list, of course, is terrorism.
Many NATO countries have agreed to step up payments considerably, as they should.
Money is beginning to pour in- NATO will be much stronger.
I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!
I look forward to reading the @CommerceGov 232 analysis of steel and aluminum- to be released in June.
Will take major action if necessary.
Bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back to the U.S.A. from the Middle East - which will mean JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Just arrived in Italy after having a very successful NATO meeting in Brussels.
Big win in Montana for Republicans!
Big win in Montana for Republicans!
Just returned from Europe.
Trip was a great success for America.
Hard work but big results!
Whenever you see the words 'sources say' in the fake news media, and they don't mention names it is very possible that those sources don't exsist but are made up by fake news writers.
Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems & Fake News until the Republican won?
it is very possible that those sources don't exist but are made up by fake news writers.
Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems & Fake News until the Republican won?
British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U.K. gave to U.S. about Manchester was leaked.
Gave me full details!
I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere.
ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!
The massive TAX CUTS/REFORM that I have submitted is moving along in the process very well, actually ahead of schedule.
Big benefits to all!
The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging & demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
Honoring the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to America.
Home of the free, because of the brave.
North Korea has shown great disrespect for their neighbor, China, by shooting off yet another ballistic missile...
but China is trying hard!
Today we remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving.
Thank you, God bless your families & God bless the USA!
I look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery later this morning.
We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military.
Very bad for U.S.
Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.
The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy.
Dems would do it, no doubt!
Who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ???
Enjoy!
So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't want him to testify.
He blows away their ase against him & now wants to clear his name by showing "the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan..
".
Witch Hunt!
Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself.
My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this.
Sick!
Hopefully Republican Senators, good people all, can quickly get together and pass a new (repeal & replace) HEALTHCARE bill.
Add saved $'s.
I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
We traveled the world to strengthen long-standing alliances, and to form new partnerships.
Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate.
Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC.
I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M.  The White House Rose Garden.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The big story is the "unmasking and surveillance" of people that took place during the Obama Administration.
Join me live at the @WhiteHouse.
My job as President is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
We need to be smart, vigilant and tough.
We need the courts to give us back our rights.
We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!
Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there - WE ARE WITH YOU.
GOD BLESS!
We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people.
At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed"!
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now?
That's because they used knives and a truck!
People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!
The Justice Dept.
The Justice Dept.
should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!
In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe.
The courts are slow and political!
@foxandfriends  Dems are taking forever to approve my people, including Ambassadors.
They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS!
Want approvals.
Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his "no reason to be alarmed" statement.
MSM is working hard to sell it!
@SecShulkin's decision is one of the biggest wins for our VETERANS in decades.
Our HEROES deserve the best!
Today, I announced an Air Traffic Control Initiative to take American air travel into the future - finally!
That's right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won't help us protect our people!
Big meeting today with Republican leadership concerning Tax Cuts and Healthcare.
We are all pushing hard - must get it right!
The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media.
They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology.
Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!
So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off.
They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar.
Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!
Today we remember the courage and bravery of our troops that stormed the beaches of Normandy 73 years ago.
Senate passed the VA Accountability Act.
The House should get this bill to my desk ASAP!
We can’t tolerate substandard care for our vets.
I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI.
Details to follow.
Getting ready to leave for Cincinnati, in the GREAT STATE of OHIO, to meet with ObamaCare victims and talk Healthcare & also Infrastructure!
Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication...
and WOW, Comey is a leaker!
Great reporting by @foxandfriends and so many others.
Thank you!
Congratulations to Jeb Hensarling & Republicans on successful House vote to repeal major parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law.
GROWTH!
An honor to join the @FaithandFreedom Coalition yesterday.
In America, we don't worship government.
We worship God.
A great honor to host and welcome leaders from around America to the @WhiteHouse Infrastructure Summit.
Time to start building in our country, with American workers & with American iron, aluminum & steel.
America is going to build again.
Under budget and ahead of schedule.
I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible.
Totally illegal?
Very 'cowardly!
My daughter, Ivanka, will be on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning.
Enjoy!
Great numbers on the economy.
All of our work, including the passage of many bills & regulation killing Executive Orders, now kicking in!
Ivanka on @foxandfriends now!
Congratulations!
Finally held our first full @Cabinet meeting today.
Congratulations to the 2016 @ClemsonFB Tigers!
The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty.
Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate.
Sad!
Well, as predicted, the 9th Circuit did it again - Ruled against the TRAVEL BAN at such a dangerous time in the history of our country.
A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...
gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection.
Totally illegal!
Fake News is at an all time high.
Where is their apology to me for all of the incorrect stories???
Heading to the Great State of Wisconsin to talk about JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Big progress being made as the Real News is reporting.
It is in a death spiral.
Obstructionist Democrats gave up, have no answer = resist!
Just arrived in Wisconsin to discuss JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
The passage of the @DeptVetAffairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act is GREAT news for veterans!
Just got back from Wisconsin.
Great day, great people!
Rep.
Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover.
Our thoughts and prayers are with him.
Happy birthday to U.S. ARMY and our soldiers.
Thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, & dedication.
Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief!
Just left hospital.
Rep.
Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter.
Pray for Steve!
They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story.
You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people!
Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?
Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, & had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared- & they talk about obstruction?
Thank you Wisconsin!
After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my "collusion with the Russians,"  nobody has been able to show any proof.
Sad!
The Fake News Media hates when I use what has turned out to be my very powerful Social Media - over 100 million people!
Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America, the economic & jobs numbers are great.
Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up!
I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!
Great news!
Back from Miami where my Cuban/American friends are very happy with what I signed today.
Another campaign promise that I did not forget!
Thoughts and prayers with the sailors of USS Fitzgerald and their families.
The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt.
Many new jobs, high business enthusiasm,.....
massive regulation cuts, 36 new legislative bills signed, great new S.C.Justice, and Infrastructure, Healthcare and Tax Cuts in works!
The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.
Camp David is a very special place.
An honor to have spent the weekend there.
Military runs it so well and are so proud of what they do!
Jay Sekulow on @foxandfriends now.
The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security.
Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P's.
Ralph Norman, who is running for Congress in SC's 5th District, will be a fantastic help to me in cutting taxes, and getting great border security and healthcare.
It was my great honor to welcome President @JC_Varela & Mrs. Varela from Panama this afternoon.
Melania and I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier.
Big day tomorrow in Georgia and South Carolina.
ObamaCare is dead.
Dems want to raise taxes big!
They can only obstruct, no ideas.
Democrat Jon Ossoff, who wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and is weak on crime and security, doesn't even live in district.
KAREN HANDEL FOR CONGRESS.
She will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong security-a hard worker who will never give up!
The U.S. once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim.
While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out.
At least I know China tried!
It was a great honor to welcome President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine to the @WhiteHouse today with @VP Pence.
Things are looking great for Karen H!
Thank you @FoxNews "Huge win for President Trump and GOP in Georgia Congressional Special Election".
Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th.
Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you!
Ralph Norman ran a fantastic race to win in the Great State of South Carolina's 5th District.
We are all honored by your success tonight!
Well, the Special Elections are over and those that want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN are 5 and O!
Democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with Republicans on Healthcare,Tax Cuts,Security.
Obstruction doesn't work!
Just landed in Iowa.
See everyone soon!
Thank you Kirkwood Community College.
Great night in Iowa - special people.
Thank you!
Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia.
By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin.
Why didn't they stop them?
Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election).
It's all a big Dem HOAX!
Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't?
It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out.
That would be very bad for the Republican Party - and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!
With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea whether there are "tapes" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.
As promised, our campaign against the MS-13 gang continues.
Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world, after only Syria.
Drug trade is largely the cause.
We will BUILD THE WALL!
Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
We're all thinking of you @SteveScalise!
@FLOTUS & I were honored to host our first WH Congressional Picnic.
A wonderful evening & tradition.
Will be on @foxandfriends.
Enjoy!
I've helped pass and signed 38 Legislative Bills, mostly with no Democratic support, and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations.
Nice!
Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia.
Did nothing about it.
WHY?
Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums & deductibles increase by over 100%.
Remember keep your doctor, keep your plan?
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action?
Focus on them, not T!
Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election.
They didn't want to hurt Hillary?
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders.
Is she allowed to so collude?
Unfair to Bernie!
I am on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas.
All they do is delay and complain.
They own ObamaCare!
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win.....
and did not want to "rock the boat".
He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling.
With 4 months looking at Russia.....
under a magnifying glass, they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding.
There is no collusion & no obstruction.
I should be given apology!
Republican Senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the Democrats.
Not easy!
Perhaps just let OCare crash & burn!
Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court.
We must keep America SAFE!
From @FoxNews "Bombshell: In 2016, Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election".
Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!
Great day for America's future Security and Safety, courtesy of the U.S. Supreme Court.
I will keep fighting for the American people, & WIN!
Wow, CNN had to retract big story on "Russia," with 3 employees forced to resign.
What about all the other phony stories they do?
FAKE NEWS!
Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories.
Ratings way down!
So they caught Fake News CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC?
What about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost?
They are all Fake News!
With ZERO Democrats to help, and a failed, expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy, the Republican Senators are working hard!
I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare.
They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!
The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me.
They don't even call to verify the facts of a story.
A Fake News Joke!
Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare.
Today, I hosted an immigration roundtable ahead of two votes taking place in Congress tomorrow.
Democrats purposely misstated Medicaid under new Senate bill - actually goes up.
From my first day in office, we’ve taken swift action to lift the crushing restrictions on American energy.
New Sugar deal negotiated with Mexico is a very good one for both Mexico and the U.S. Had no deal for many years which hurt U.S. badly.
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore).
Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.....
to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me.
She was bleeding badly from a face-lift.
I said no!
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
Join me LIVE with @VP, @SecretaryPerry, @SecretaryZinke and @EPAScottPruitt.
Good news out of the House with the passing of 'No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.
' Hopefully Senate will follow.
Statement on House Passage of Kate’s Law and No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.
When it comes to the future of America’s energy needs, we will FIND IT, we will DREAM IT, and we will BUILD IT.
Our new American Energy Policy will unlock MILLIONS of jobs & TRILLIONS in wealth.
Just finished a very good meeting with the President of South Korea.
Many subjects discussed including North Korea and new trade deal!
If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!
Crime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help.
Watched low rated @Morning_Joe for first time in long time.
FAKE NEWS.
He called me to stop a National Enquirer article.
I said no!
The era of strategic patience with the North Korea regime has failed.
That patience is over.
America will THINK BIG once again.
Happy Canada Day to all of the great people of Canada and to your Prime Minister and my new found friend @JustinTrudeau.
Word is that @Greta Van Susteren was let go by her out of control bosses at @NBC & @Comcast because she refused to go along w/ 'Trump hate!
Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL.
What are they trying to hide?
Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses.
Too bad!
The FAKE & FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media - but remember, I won the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media.
My use of social media is not Presidential - it’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.
Make America Great Again!
We will always take care of our GREAT VETERANS.
The dishonest media will NEVER keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of our GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE!
Stock Market at all time high, unemployment at lowest level in years (wages will start going up) and our base has never been stronger!
Will be speaking with Germany and France this morning.
Spoke yesterday with the King of Saudi Arabia about peace in the Middle-East.
Interesting things are happening!
Will be speaking with Italy this morning!
At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border & so much else!
Thank you to Shawn Steel for the nice words on @FoxNews.
Really great numbers on jobs & the economy!
Things are starting to kick in now, and we have just begun!
Don't like steel & aluminum dumping!
Dow hit a new intraday all-time high!
I wonder whether or not the Fake News Media will so report?
North Korea has just launched another missile.
Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?
Hard to believe that South Korea nd Japan will put up with this much longer.
Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!
Getting ready to celebrate the 4th of July with a big crowd at the White House.
Happy 4th to everyone.
Our country will grow and prosper!
Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years!
I would like to see them go even lower.
Getting ready to leave for Poland, after which I will travel to Germany for the G-20.
Will be back on Saturday.
The United States made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history.
Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us?
Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter.
So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!
Congratulations to the dedicated professionals of the USSS as they celebrate their 152nd anniversary.
Thank you!
On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and myself, thank you Poland!
America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Poland in the fight to eradicate the evils of terrorism and extremism.
THE WEST WILL NEVER BE BROKEN.
Our values will PREVAIL.
Our people will THRIVE and our civilization will TRIUMPH!
A strong Poland is a blessing to the nations of Europe, and a strong Europe is a blessing to the West, and to the world.
My experience yesterday in Poland was a great one.
Thank you to everyone, including the haters, for the great reviews of the speech!
Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA.
Disgraceful!
I look forward to all meetings today with world leaders, including my meeting with Vladimir Putin.
Much to discuss.
I will represent our country well and fight for its interests!
Fake News Media will never cover me accurately but who cares!
Thank you!
Law enforcement & military did a spectacular job in Hamburg.
Everybody felt totally safe despite the anarchists.
Leaving Hamburg for Washington, D.C. and the WH.
Just left China’s President Xi where we had an excellent meeting on trade & North Korea.
Thank you @SenatorDole, very kind!
The G 20 Summit was a great success for the U.S. - Explained that the U.S. must fix the many bad trade deals it has made.
Will get done!
I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election.
He vehemently denied it.
I've already given my opinion  negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives.
Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!
Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.....
and safe.
Questions were asked about why the CIA & FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER, and were rejected, still don't ave it.
Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize).
Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?
Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin.
Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
For years, even as a "civilian," I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare.
Now they finally have their chance!
Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding.
Many lives can be saved.
Came out of meeting.
Good!
The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit  doesn't mean I think it can happen.
It can't-but a ceasefire can,& did!
James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media.
That is so illegal!
I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!
When I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries, I asked Ivanka to hold seat.
Very standard.
Angela M agrees!
If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother,as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!
The Senate Democrats have only confirmed 48 of 197 Presidential Nominees.
They  can't win so all they do is slow things down & obstruct!
Working hard to get the Olympics for the United States (L.A.).
Stay tuned!
Marine Plane crash in Mississippi is heartbreaking.
Melania and I send our deepest condolences to all!
Big wins against ISIS!
My son, Donald, will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 P.M.
He is a great person who loves our country!
My son Donald did a good job last night.
He was open, transparent and innocent.
This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history.
Sad!
Remember, when you hear the words "sources say" from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist.
ISIS is on the run & will soon be wiped out of Syria & Iraq, illegal border crossings are way down (75%) & MS 13 gangs are being removed..
@WashTimes states "Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump".
Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats.
Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with.
Disgraceful!
The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things.
Getting rdy to leave for France @ the invitation of President Macron to celebrate & honor Bastille Day and 100yrs since U.S. entry into WWI.
Stock market hits another high with spirit and enthusiasm so positive.
Jobs outlook looking very good!
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Big WIN today for building the wall.
It will secure the border & save lives.
Now the full House & Senate must act!
Just landed in Paris, France with @FLOTUS Melania.
Melania and I were thrilled to join the dedicated men and women of the @USEmbassyFrance, members of the U.S. Military and their families.
President @EmmanuelMacron, Thank you for the beautiful welcome ceremony at Les Invalides today!
Great bilateral meetings at Élysée Palace w/ President @EmmanuelMacron.
The friendship between our two nations and ourselves is unbreakable.
Great evening with President @EmmanuelMacron & Mrs. Macron.
Went to Eiffel Tower for dinner.
Relationship with France stronger than ever.
Republicans Senators are working hard to get their failed ObamaCare replacement approved.
I will be at my desk, pen in hand!
So impt Rep Senators, under leadership of @SenateMajLdr McConnell get healthcare plan approved.
After 7yrs of O'Care disaster, must happen!
After all of these years of suffering thru ObamaCare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised!
@VP Mike Pence is working hard on HealthCare and getting our wonderful Republican Senators to do what is right for the people.
The United States mourns for the victims of Nice, France.
We pledge our solidarity with France against terror.
Great conversations with President @EmmanuelMacron and his representatives on trade, military and security.
Just landed from Paris, France.
It was an incredible visit with President @EmmanuelMacron.
A lot discussed and accomplished in two days!
President @EmmanuelMacron, Thank you for inviting Melania and myself to such a historic celebration in France.
Honored to serve as Commander-in-Chief to the courageous men and women of our U.S. Armed Forces.
A grateful nation thanks you!
Stock Market at new all-time high!
Working on new trade deals that will be great for U.S. and its workers!
Stock Market hit another all-time high yesterday - despite the Russian hoax story!
Also, jobs numbers are starting to look very good!
Will be at the Women's U.S. Open today!
Next week the Senate is going to vote on legislation to save Americans from the ObamaCare DISASTER.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?
Thank you to all of the supporters, who far out-numbered the protesters, yesterday at the Women's U.S. Open.
Very cool!
Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.
The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!
Heading back to Washington, D.C. Much will be accomplished this week on trade, the military and security!
Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent.
That's politics!
Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate.
Dems will join in!
We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans.
Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard.
We will return!
As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan.
Stay tuned!
With only a very small majority, the Republicans in the House & Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct, no votes!
The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes.
Even parts of full Repeal need 60.8 Dems control Senate.
Crazy!
Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick".
All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany.
Press knew!
The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest!
Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!
I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare.
They MUST keep their promise to America!
The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, & it will get even better at lunchtime.
The Dems scream death as OCare dies!
Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family.
Get well soon.
Departing The Pentagon after meetings with @VP Pence, Secretary James Mattis, and our great teams.
I am asking all citizens to believe in yourselves, believe in your future, and believe, once more, in America.
Billions of dollars in investments & thousands of new jobs in America!
Sean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright!
A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.
These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!
The Failing New York Times foiled U.S. attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist,Al-Baghdadi.
This morning I will be going to the Commissioning Ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world, The Gerald R. Ford.
Norfolk, Va.
While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.
So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes....
What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.
My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!
In all fairness to Anthony Scaramucci, he wanted to endorse me 1st, before the Republican Primaries started, but didn't think I was running!
The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and, after 7 years, vote to Repeal and Replace.
Next, Tax Reform and Infrastructure.
WIN!
ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists, no ideas or votes, only obstruction.
It is solely up to the 52 Republican Senators!
Join me live for the commissioning ceremony of the USS Gerald R. Ford!
A ship is only as good as the people who serve on it — and the AMERICAN SAILOR is the BEST in the world.
American steel & American hands have constructed a 100,000 ton message to the world: American MIGHT IS SECOND TO NONE!
As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!
It's very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President.
It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion, even if should be positive, is bad!
If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
Thank you to @LOUDOBBS for giving the first six months of the Trump Administration an A+.
S.C.,reg cutting,Stock M, jobs,border etc.
= TRUE!
Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought, and it begins with the Fake News!
After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia".
So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?
Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia," spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!
Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it.
Arriving at Joint Base Andrews with @SecretaryPerry, @SecretaryZinke, and @SecPriceMD.....
The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad.....
So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News.
They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN.
Lobbyist for Amazon and taxes?
Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?
Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - "quietly working to boost Clinton".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!
Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!
Big day for HealthCare.
After 7 years of talking, we will soon see whether or not Republicans are willing to step up to the plate!
ObamaCare is torturing the American People.
The Democrats have fooled the people long enough.
Repeal or Repeal & Replace!
I have pen in hand.
So great that John McCain is coming back to vote.
Brave - American hero!
Thank you John.
Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians.
Witch Hunt.
Next up, 11 year old Barron Trump!
Working on major Trade Deal with the United Kingdom.
Could be very big & exciting.
JOBS!
The E.U. is very protectionist with the U.S. STOP!
This will be a very interesting day for HealthCare.
The Dems are obstructionists but the Republicans can have a great victory for the people!
Will be traveling to the Great State of Ohio tonight.
Big crowd expected.
See you there!
The American people have waited long enough.
There has been enough talk and no action for seven years.
Now is the time for action!
Joint Press Conference with Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon beginning shortly.
Join us live!
@SenJohnMcCain-Thank you for coming to D.C. for such a vital vote.
Congrats to all Rep.
We can now deliver grt healthcare to all Americans!
Just arrived in Youngstown, Ohio with @FLOTUS Melania!
It was my great honor to join our wonderful Veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Youngstown, Ohio this evening.
A grateful nation salutes you!
People of Ohio are fantastic.
Thank you so much.
What an evening!
The crowd in Ohio was amazing last night - broke all records.
We all had a great time in a great State.
Will be back soon!
Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday.
Too bad!
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow ansgender individuals to  serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.
Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming ictory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.
Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got ig dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives.
Drain the Swamp!
IN AMERICA WE DON'T WORSHIP GOVERNMENT - WE WORSHIP GOD!
Congratulations to Boys and Girls Nation.
It was my great honor to welcome you to the WH today!
Thank you Foxconn, for investing $10 BILLION DOLLARS with the potential for up to 13K new jobs in Wisconsin!
Wow, the Failing @nytimes said about @foxandfriends "....
the most powerful T.V. show in America".
Come on Republican Senators, you can do it on Healthcare.
After 7 years, this is your chance to shine!
Don't let the American people down!
Big progress being made in ridding our country of MS-13 gang members and gang members in general.
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
Join me live as we recognize the first responders to the June 14th shooting involving @SteveScalise.
Today, we gathered in the East Room to pay tribute to the HEROES whose courageous actions under fire saved so many lives in Alexandria, VA.
It was my great HONOR to present our nation's highest award for a public safety officer - THE MEDAL OF VALOR to FIVE AMERICAN HEROES!
Go Republican Senators, Go!
Get there after waiting for 7 years.
Give America great healthcare!
As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal.
Watch!
If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate, they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60 Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60.
So many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes....
We will always ENFORCE our laws, PROTECT our borders, and SUPPORT our police!
Departing for Long Island now.
I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff.
He is a Great American nd a Great Leader.
John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security.
I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country.
We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!
We will defend our country, protect our communities and put the safety of the AMERICAN PEOPLE FIRST!
In other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election - and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices.
Witch Hunt!
Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW!
It is killing the R Party, allows 8 Dems to control country.
A JOKE!
The very outdated filibuster rule must go.
Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate.
Mitch M, go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN.
IT'S TIME!
Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW.
They look like fools and are just wasting time Dems totally control the U.S. Senate.
Many great Republican bills will never pass, like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare.
Get smart!
If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance, they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute.
They are laughing at R's.
MAKE CHANGE!
After seven years of "talking" Repeal & Replace, the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding ObamaCare!
If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!
U.S. Stock Market up almost 20% since Election!
Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters, Repeal & Replace is not dead!
Demand another vote before voting on any other bill!
I love reading about all of the "geniuses" who were so instrumental in my election success.
Problem is, most don't exist.
I am very disappointed in China.
Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk.
We will no longer allow this to continue.
China could easily solve this problem!
Don't give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace...
and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines & more.
If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?
Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos!
A great day at the White House!
Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today.
Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day.
Mainstream media seldom mentions!
Only the Fake News Media and Trump enemies want me to stop using Social Media (110 million people).
Only way for me to get the truth out!
Small business owners are the DREAMERS & INNOVATORS who are powering us into the future!
It was my great honor to pay tribute to a VET who went above & beyond the call of duty to PROTECT our COMRADES, our COUNTRY, & OUR FREEDOM!
I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects U.S. workers & taxpayers.
I love the White House, one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen.
Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels.
Stock Market at an all-time high.
That doesn't just happen!
I am continuing to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations.
Much work left to do but effect will be great!
Business & jobs will grow.
Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous  low.
You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!
See you tonight Huntington, West Virginia!
Today, I  announced another historic breakthrough for the VA.
We are working tirelessly to keep our promises to our GREAT VETERANS!
Just arrived in West Virginia for a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rally in Huntington at 7:00pmE.
Massive crowd expected - tune in!
Thank you West Virginia!
All across the country, Americans of every kind are coming together w/one simple goal: to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Toyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs.
A great investment in American manufacturing!
and don't forget that Foxconn will be spending up to 10 billion dollars on a top of the line plant/plants in Wisconsin.
Consumer confidence is at a 16 year high....
and for good reason.
Much more regulation "busting" to come.
Working hard on tax cuts & reform!
West Virginia was incredible last night.
Crowds and enthusiasm were beyond, GDP at 3%, wow!
Dem Governor became a Republican last night.
Excellent Jobs Numbers just released - and I have only just begun.
Many job stifling regulations continue to fall.
Movement back to USA!
No matter the mission, the brave men & women of our @USCG proudly answer the call to serve 24/7/365.
THANK YOU and HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Great work being done by @FEMA @DHSgov w/state & local leaders to prepare for hurricane season.
Preparedness is an investment in our future!
Prosperity is coming back to our shores because we are putting America WORKERS and FAMILIES first.
Working in Bedminster, N.J., as long planned construction is being done at the White House.
This is not a vacation - meetings and calls!
The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea.
China and Russia voted with us.
Very big financial impact!
After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington, it is great to see the A.G. taking action!
For National Security, the tougher the better!
Thank you Nicole!
United Nations Resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on North Korea.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Fake News refuses to report the success of the first 6 months: S.C., surging economy & jobs,border & military security,ISIS & MS-13 etc.
Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea.
Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions.
The failing @nytimes, which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized), is totally inept!
The Trump base is far bigger &  stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling).
Look at rallies in Penn, Iowa, Ohio West Virginia.
The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs upreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation & so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together.
Will never change!
Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation.
Going to New York next week for more meetings.
Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a  phony Vietnam con artist!
Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal.
He told stories about his Vietnam battles and onquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie.
He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child.
Now he judges collusion?
The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!
How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?
After many years of failure,countries are coming together to  finally address the dangers posed by North Korea.
We must be tough & decisive!
E-mails show that the AmazonWashingtonPost and the FailingNewYorkTimes were reluctant to cover the Clinton/Lynch secret meeting in plane.
After 200 days, rarely has any Administration achieved what we have achieved..
not even close!
Don't believe the Fake News Suppression Polls!
Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama.
He has my complete and total endorsement!
My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal.
It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before opefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!
Senator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations," but I don't think so.
After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?
Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done.
Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!
Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing.
You can do it!
@IvankaTrump will lead the U.S. delegation to India this fall, supporting women’s entrepreneurship globally.
Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely.
Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!
We want to make sure that we have the workforce development programs we need to ensure these jobs are....
As promised on the campaign trail, we will provide opportunity for Americans to gain skills needed to succeed & thrive as the economy grows!
Press Conference - Following National Security Briefing in Bedminster, New Jersey.
We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for.
There is no place for this kind of violence in America.
Lets come together as one!
Am in Bedminster for meetings & press conference on V.A. & all that we have done, and are doing, to make it better-but Charlottesville sad!
What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.
We must remember this truth: No matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are ALL AMERICANS FIRST.
We will continue to follow developments in Charlottesville, and will provide whatever assistance is needed.
We are ready, willing and able.
Deepest condolences to the families & fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today.
You're all among the best this nation produces.
Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia.
So sad!
Heading to Washington this morning.
Much work to do.
Focus on trade and military.
Luther Strange of the Great State of Alabama has my endorsement.
He is strong on Border & Wall, the military, tax cuts & law enforcement.
The Obstructionist Democrats have given us (or not fixed) some of the worst trade deals in World History.
I am changing that fast!
Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!
@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!
Big day in Washington, D.C., even though White House & Oval Office are being renovated.
Great trade deals coming for American workers!
Leaving for New York City and meetings on military purchases and trade.
Feels good to be home after seven months, but the White House is very special, there is no place like it...
and the U.S. is really my home!
Senator Luther Strange, who is doing a great job for the people of Alabama, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:15.
Tough on crime, borders etc.
Big day in Alabama.
Vote for Luther Strange, he will be great!
For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place.
Grandstanders should not have gone on.
JOBS!
Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers.
Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!
Congratulation to Roy Moore and Luther Strange for being the final two and heading into a September runoff in Alabama.
Exciting race!
Congratulations John!
Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision.
The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Wow, Senator Luther Strange picked up a lot of additional support since my endorsement.
Now in September runoff.
Strong on Wall & Crime!
Memorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer, a truly special young woman.
She will be long remembered by all!
Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both.
Thank you all!
Just landed in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Today in Bedminster I signed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, joined by @DeptVetAffairs @SecShulkin.
Join me at 7:00 P.M. on Tuesday, August 22nd in Phoenix, Arizona at the Phoenix Convention Center!
THANK YOU @MayorGimenez for following the RULE OF LAW!
Sanctuary cities make our country LESS SAFE!
Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists  people like Ms. Heyer.
Such a disgusting lie.
He just can't forget his election trouncing.
The people of South Carolina will remember!
The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is.
They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc.
Shame!
Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate.
He's toxic!
Many meetings today in Bedminster including with Secretary Linda M and Small Business.
Job numbers are looking great!
Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.
You n't change history, but you can learn from it.
Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson?
So foolish!
Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!
The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help.
Be tough & strong, we love you!
Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught.
There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!
Homeland Security and law enforcement are on alert & closely watching for any sign of trouble.
Our borders are far tougher than ever before!
The Obstructionist Democrats make Security for our country very difficult.
They use the courts and associated delay at all times.
Must stop!
Radical Islamic Terrorism must be stopped by whatever means necessary!
The courts must give us back our protective rights.
Have to be tough!
Heading to Camp David for major meeting on National Security, the Border and the Military (which we are rapidly building to strongest ever).
I have directed that U.S. Cyber Command be elevated to the status of a Unified Combatant Command focused on....
Just returned to Bedminster, NJ from Camp David.
GREAT meeting on National Security, the Border and the Military!
My thoughts and prayers are with the @KissimmeePolice and their loved ones.
We are with you!
I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service.
He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton - it was great!
Important day spent at Camp David with our very talented Generals and military leaders.
Many decisions made, including on Afghanistan.
Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at @BreitbartNews...
maybe even better than ever before.
Fake News needs the competition!
Looks like many anti-police agitators in Boston.
Police are looking tough and smart!
Thank you.
Great job by all law enforcement officers and Boston Mayor @Marty_Walsh.
Our great country has been divided for decades.
Sometimes you need protest in order to heel, & we will heel, & be stronger than ever before!
Our great country has been divided for decades.
Sometimes you need protest in order to heal, & we will heal, & be stronger than ever before!
I want to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate.
Our country will soon come together as one!
Heading back to Washington after working hard and watching some of the worst and most dishonest Fake News reporting I have ever seen!
Jerry Falwell of Liberty University was fantastic on @foxandfriends.
The Fake News should listen to what he had to say.
Thanks Jerry!
Thank you, the very dishonest Fake News Media is out of control!
Join me live from Fort Myer in Arlington, Virginia.
Thank you to the men and women of Fort Myer, and every member of the U.S. Military at home and abroad.
Was with great people last night in Fort Myer, Virginia.
The future of our country is strong!
See you at 7:00 P.M. tonight Phoenix, Arizona!
We will push onward to victory w/hope in our hearts, courage in our souls & everlasting pride in each & every one of you.
God Bless America.
THANK YOU to all of the great men and women at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility in Yuma, Arizona & around the United States!
Thank you Arizona.
Beautiful turnout of 15,000 in Phoenix tonight!
Not only does the media give a platform to hate groups, but the media turns a blind eye to the gang violence on our streets!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house.
I love the Great State of Arizona.
Not a fan of Jeff Flake, weak on crime & border!
Last night in Phoenix I read the things from my statements on Charlottesville that the Fake News Media didn't cover fairly.
People got it!
If Republican Senate doesn't get rid of the Filibuster Rule & go to a simple majority, which the Dems would do, they are just wasting time!
As long as we have faith in each other and confidence in our values, then there is no challenge too great for us to conquer!
A great honor to sign the Veterans Appeals Improvement & Modernization Act into law w/ @AmericanLegion @SecShulkin.
Donald E. Ballard, on behalf of the people of the United States, THANK YOU for your courageous service.
YOU INSPIRE US ALL!
I requested that Mitch M & Paul R tie the Debt Ceiling legislation into the popular V.A. Bill (which just passed) for easy approval.
They didn't do it so now we have a big deal with Dems holding them up (as usual) on Debt Ceiling approval.
Could have been so easy-now a mess!
The Fake News is now complaining about my different types of back to back speeches.
Well, their was Afghanistan (somber), the big Rally nthusiastic, dynamic and fun) and the American Legion - V.A. (respectful and strong).
To bad the Dems have no one who can change tones!
The Fake News is now complaining about my different types of back to back speeches.
Well, there was Afghanistan (somber), the big Rally nthusiastic, dynamic and fun) and the American Legion - V.A. (respectful and strong).
To bad the Dems have no one who can change tones!
James Clapper, who famously got caught lying to Congress, is now an authority on Donald Trump.
Will he show you his beautiful letter to me?
(enthusiastic, dynamic and fun) and the American Legion - V.A. (respectful and strong).
Too bad the Dems have no one who can change tones!
James Clapper, who famously got caught lying to Congress, is now an authority on Donald Trump.
Will he show you his beautiful letter to me?
The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed!
That should NEVER have happened!
On Tuesday, I visited with the incredible men & women of @ICEgov & @DHSgov Border Patrol in Yuma, AZ.
Thank you.
We respect & cherish you!
A great honor to spend time with our brave HEROES at the @USMC Air Station Yuma.
THANK YOU for your service to the United Staes of America!
A GREAT HONOR to spend time with our BRAVE HEROES at the @USMC Air Station Yuma.
THANK YOU for your service to the United States of America!
If Senate Republicans don't get rid of the Filibuster Rule and go to a 51% majority, few bills will be passed.
General John Kelly is doing a fantastic job as Chief of Staff.
Few, if any, Administrations have done more in just 7 months than the Trump A. Bills passed, regulations killed, border, military, ISIS, SC!
Nick Adams, "Retaking America"  "Best things of this presidency aren't reported about.
Convinced this will be perhaps best presidency ever".
Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18.
Tennessee not happy!
I have spoken w/ @GovAbbott of Texas and @LouisianaGov Edwards.
Just arrived at Camp David where I am closely watching the path and doings of Hurricane Harvey, as it strengthens to a Category 3.
BE SAFE!
Just arrived at Camp David, where I am monitoring the path and doings of Hurricane Harvey (as it strengthens to a Class 3).
Storm turned Hurricane is getting much bigger and more powerful than projected.
Federal Government is on site and ready to respond.
Be safe!
At the request of the Governor of Texas, I have signed the Disaster Proclamation, which unleashes the full force of government help!
I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
He kept Arizona safe!
You are doing a great job - the world is watching!
Be safe..
@ChuckGrassley - got your message loud and clear.
Wonderful coordination between Federal, State and Local Governments in the Great State of Texas - TEAMWORK!
Record setting rainfall.
A great book by a great guy, highly recommended!
Great coordination between agencies at all levels of government.
Continuing rains and flash floods are being dealt with.
Thousands rescued.
Many people are now saying that this is the worst storm/hurricane they have ever seen.
Good news is that we have great talent on the ground.
I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption.
The focus must be life and safety.
I will also be going to a wonderful state, Missouri, that I won by a lot in '16.
Dem C.M. is opposed to big tax cuts.
Republican will win S!
With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL.
Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.
We are in the NAFTA (worst trade deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico & Canada.
Both being very difficult,may have to terminate?
Major rescue operations underway!
HISTORIC rainfall in Houston, and all over Texas.
Floods are unprecedented, and more rain coming.
Spirit of the people is incredible.
Thanks!
Leaving now for Texas!
@foxandfriends   We are not looking to fill all of those positions.
Don't need many of them - reduce size of government.
The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years.
Talking is not the answer!
After witnessing first hand the horror & devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey,my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!
After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines, it makes me wonder, WHY?
Will be leaving for Missouri soon for a speech on tax cuts and tax reform - so badly needed!
Texas & Louisiana: We are w/ you today, we are w/ you tomorrow, & we will be w/ you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to restore, recover, & REBUILD!
First responders have been doing heroic work.
Their courage & devotion has saved countless lives – they represent the very best of America!
THANK YOU to all of the incredible HEROES in Texas.
America is with you!
Texas is heeling fast thanks to all of the great men & women who have been working so hard.
But still, so much to do.
Will be back tomorrow!
Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...
and so much more.
A rigged system!
General John Kelly is doing a great job as Chief of Staff.
I could not be happier or more impressed - and this Administration continues to.....
get things done at a record clip.
Many big decisions to be made over the coming days and weeks.
AMERICA FIRST!
Texas is healing fast thanks to all of the great men & women who have been working so hard.
But still so much to do.
Will be back tomorrow!
Stock Market up 5 months in a row!
I will be going to Texas and Louisiana tomorrow with First Lady.
Great progress being made!
Spending weekend working at White House.
On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania & myself, THANK YOU for today's update & GREAT WORK!
Departing for Texas and Louisiana with @FLOTUS Melania right now @JBA_NAFW.
We will see you soon.
America is with you!
TEXAS: We are with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will be with you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to restore, recover, and REBUILD!
Together, we will prevail in the GREAT state of Texas.
We love you!
The Manufacturing Index rose to 59%, the highest level since early 2011 - and we can do much better!
Just got back to the White House from the Great States of Texas and Louisiana, where things are going well.
Such cooperation & coordination!
Remember, Sunday is National Prayer Day (by Presidential Proclamation)!
So much SPIRIT in LA!
Thank you to all of our HEREOS who saved many lives.
North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test.
Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.......
North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.
South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!
I will be meeting General Kelly, General Mattis and other military leaders at the White House to discuss North Korea.
Thank you.
The United States is considering, in addition to other options, stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.
We are building our future with American hands, American labor, American iron, aluminum and steel.
Big week coming up!
Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA!
I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.
I look forward to working w/ D's + R's in Congress to address immigration reform in a way that puts hardworking citizens of our country 1st.
Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do).
If they can't, I will revisit this issue!
Will be going to North Dakota today to discuss tax reform and tax cuts.
We are the highest taxed nation in the world - that will change.
Watching Hurricane closely.
My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida.
No rest for the weary!
Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!
Just spoke w/ Governors Rick Scott of Florida, Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands & Ricardo Rosselló of Puerto Rico.
WE ARE W/ YOU ALL!
Wonderful to be in North Dakota with the incredible hardworking men & women @ the Andeavor Refinery.
Thank you for joining me in Mandan, ND Gov.
@DougBurgum, Lt.
Gov.
@BrentSanfordND, @SenJohnHoeven, @RepKevinCramer & @SenatorHeitkamp.
If we want to renew our PROSPERITY, restore OPPORTUNITY, & re-establish our economic DOMINANCE, then we need tax reform that is pro-growth..
We want our companies to hire & grow in AMERICA, to raise wages for AMERICAN workers, & to help rebuild our AMERICAN cities & towns!
Hurricane Irma is raging but we have great teams of talented and brave people already in place and ready to help.
Be careful, be safe!
Thank you, our great honor!
For all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about - No action!
Welcome to the @WhiteHouse, Amir Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah of Kuwait!
Together, we will show the world that the forces of destruction and extremism are NO MATCH for the BLESSINGS of PROSPERITY and PEACE!
During my trip to Saudi Arabia, I spoke to the leaders of more than 50 Arab & Muslim nations about the need to confront our shared enemies..
We will confront ANY challenge, no matter how strong the winds or high the water.
Hurricane Irma is of epic proportion, perhaps bigger than we have ever seen.
Be safe and get out of its way,if possible.
Federal G is ready!
Our incredible U.S. Coast Guard saved more than 15,000 lives last week with Harvey.
Irma could be even tougher.
We love our Coast Guard!
Republicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen!
Even worse, the Senate Filibuster Rule will ever allow the Republicans to pass even great legislation.
It is a Repub Death Wish!
Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP.
Don't wait until the end of September.
Needed now more than ever.
Hurry!
Churches in Texas should be entitled to reimbursement from FEMA Relief Funds for helping victims of Hurricane Harvey (just like others).
This is a storm of enormous destructive power, and I ask everyone in the storm’s path to heed ALL instructions from government officials.
Heed the advice of @FLGovScott!
"If you're in an evacuation zone, you need to get to a shelter...
there's not many hours left".
Gov.
The U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA and all Federal and State brave people are ready.
Here comes Irma.
God bless everyone!
May God Forever Bless the United States of America.
Fascinating to watch people writing books and major articles about me and yet they know nothing about me & have zero access.
The devastation left by Hurricane Irma was far greater, at least in certain locations,than anyone thought - but amazing people working hard!
Congratulations to Eric & Lara on the birth of their son, Eric "Luke" Trump this morning!
It was a great honor to welcome Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak of Malaysia and his distinguished delegation to the @WhiteHouse today!
The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut & Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin.
Move fast Congress!
I will be traveling to Florida tomorrow to meet with our great Coast Guard, FEMA and many of the brave first responders & others.
With Irma and Harvey devastation, Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before.
Go Congress, go!
China has a business tax rate of 15%.
We should do everything possible to match them in order to win with our economy.
Jobs and wages!
Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss.
She lost the debates and lost her direction!
The "deplorables" came back to haunt Hillary.
They expressed their feelings loud and clear.
She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!
No deal was made last night on DACA.
Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent.
Would be subject to vote.
The WALL, which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls, will continue to be built.
Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military?
Really!
ey have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age.
Am leaving now for Florida to see our GREAT first responders and to thank the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA etc.
A real disaster, much work to do!
Just left Florida for D.C. The people and spirit in THAT GREAT STATE is unbelievable.
Damage horrific but will be better than ever!
Spoke to President of Mexico to give condolences on terrible earthquake.
Unable to reach for 3 days b/c of his cell phone reception at site.
Bernie Sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan - a curse on the U.S. & its people I told Republicans to approve healthcare fast or this would happen.
But don't worry, I will veto because I love our country & its people.
WE ARE WITH YOU FLORIDA!
FLORIDA- Just like TX, WE are w/you today, we are w/you tomorrow, & we will be w/you EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER, to RESTORE, RECOVER, & REBUILD!
With the ridiculous Filibuster Rule in the Senate, Republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation, rather than 51.
Can't get votes, END NOW!
Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.
These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.
Must be proactive!
Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.
The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!
The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!
We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years.
Must be proactive & nasty!
ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming).
People are dumping it in RECORD numbers.
Apologize for untruth!
CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!
Frank “FX” Giaccio- On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania & myself, THANK YOU for doing a GREAT job this morning!
@NatlParkService gives you an A+!
NEVER forget our HEROES held prisoner or who have gone missing in action while serving their country.
Our hearts & prayers go out to the people of London, who suffered a vicious terrorist attack....
We will defend our people, our nations and our civilization from all who dare to threaten our way of life...
HAPPY 70th BIRTHDAY to the @USAirForce!
The American people are eternally grateful.
Thank you for keeping America PROUD, STRONG and FREE!
A great deal of good things happening for our country.
Jobs and Stock Market at all time highs, and I believe will be getting even better!
Attorney General Bill Shuette will be a fantastic Governor for the great State of Michigan.
I am bringing back your jobs and Bill will help!
I will be in Huntsville, Alabama, on Saturday night to support Luther Strange for Senate.
"Big Luther" is a great guy who gets things done!
Attorney General Bill Schuette will be a fantastic Governor for the great State of Michigan.
I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night.
Asked him how Rocket Man is doing.
Long gas lines forming in North Korea.
Too bad!
Thank you!
My great honor!
Important meetings and calls scheduled for today.
Military and economy are getting stronger by the day, and our enemies know it.
Happy 70th Birthday @USAirForce!
Happy 70th Birthday @CIA!
We commend SG @AntonioGuterres & his call for the UN to focus more on people & less on bureaucracy.
Looking forward to meeting with Prime Minister @Netanyahu shortly.
Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!
Such an honor to have my good friend, Israel PM @Netanyahu, join us w/ his delegation in NYC this afternoon.
It was a great honor to be with President @EmmanuelMacron of France this afternoon with his delegation.
Great bilateral meeting!
We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela, and we want it to happen very, very soon!
Big day at the United Nations - many good things, and some tricky ones, happening.
We have a great team.
God bless the people of Mexico City.
We are with you and will be there for you.
It was a great honor to have spoken before the countries of the world at the United Nations.
The true question for the @UN...
Puerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane.
Be careful, our hearts are with you- will be there to help!
A great and important day at the United Nations.
Met with leaders of many nations who agree with much (or all) of what I stated in my speech!
So nice, thank you!
I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night - the worst ever.
Smartest people of them all are the "DEPLORABLES".
Thank you Jacob!
Big meetings today at the United Nations.
So many interesting leaders.
America First will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
After allowing North Korea to research and build Nukes while Secretary of State (Bill C also), Crooked Hillary now criticizes.
The world is noticing, thanks!
Thank you  @foxandfriends - great show!
Rand Paul is a friend of mine but he is such a negative force when it comes to fixing healthcare.
Graham-Cassidy Bill is GREAT!
Ends Ocare!
I hope Republican Senators will vote for Graham-Cassidy and fulfill their promise to Repeal & Replace ObamaCare.
Money direct to States!
Looking forward to Friday night in the Great State of Alabama.
I am supporting "Big" Luther Strange because he was so loyal & helpful to me!
It was a great honor to be with King Abdullah II of Jordan and his delegation this morning.
We had a GREAT bilateral meeting!
Honored to meet w/ Pres Abbas from the Palestinian Authority & his delegation, who have been working hard w/everybody involved toward peace.
Honored to host a luncheon for African leaders this afternoon.
Great discussions on the challenges & opportunities facing our nations today.
On behalf of all Americans, I want to wish Jewish families many blessings in the New Year.
Alabama is sooo lucky to have a candidate like "Big" Luther Strange.
Smart, tough on crime, borders & trade, loves Vets & Military.
Tuesday!
I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions.
It does!
A great Bill.
Repeal & Replace.
The NRA strongly endorses Luther Strange for Senator of Alabama.
That means all gun owners should vote for Big Luther.
He won't let you down!
Senator (Doctor) Bill Cassidy is a class act who really cares about people and their Health(care), he doesn't lie-just wants to help people!
Governor @RicardoRossello-  We are with you and the people of Puerto Rico.
Stay safe!
It was a pleasure to have President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan with us this morning!
It was wonderful to have President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine with us in New York City today.
It was a great privilege to meet with President Moon of South Korea.
Stay tuned!
Today, I announced a new Executive Order with re: to North Korea.
Senator Luther Strange has gone up a lot in the polls since I endorsed him a month ago.
Now a close runoff.
A big day for the U.S. at the United Nations!
Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as "the Republican who saved ObamaCare".
Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!
Thank you!
The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook.
What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media "screaming" for Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Next, she was a bad candidate!
Will be in Alabama tonight.
Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement, but will be very close.
He loves Alabama, and so do I!
Thank you to Doug Parker and American Airlines for all of the help you have given to the U.S. with Hurricane flights.
Fantastic job!
Heading to Alabama now, big crowd!
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves.
He campaigned on Repeal & Replace.
Let Arizona down!
Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high.
Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods.
Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do.
Better control &  management.
Great for Arizona.
McCain let his best friend L.G. down!
I know Rand Paul and I think he may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!
Alaska had a 200% plus increase in premiums under ObamaCare, worst in the country.
Deductibles high, people angry!
Lisa M comes through.
It was great being with Luther Strange last night in Alabama.
What great people, what a crowd!
Vote Luther on Tuesday.
Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.
Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect ur Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem.
If not, YOU'RE FIRED.
Find something else to do!
Very proud of our incredible First Lady (@FLOTUS.
) She is a truly great representative for our country!
Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.
They are also working with North Korea.
Not much of an agreement we have!
Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage".
Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived.
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.
Tell them to stand!
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast.
Fire or suspend!
NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN.
Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country.
Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country.
Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable.
Bad ratings!
Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony.
Great team!
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Alaska, Arizona, Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal.
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country.
NFL should change policy!
Making America Safe is my number one priority.
We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet.
So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans.
They won't put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag - they said it loud and clear!
Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total).
These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race.
It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem.
NFL must respect this!
The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night.
Important meetings taking place today.
Big tax cuts & reform..
General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!
Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.
Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble.....
It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated.
Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars wed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.
Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well.
A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care.
My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk!
Big election tomorrow in the Great State of Alabama.
Vote for Senator Luther Strange, tough on crime & border - will never let you down!
Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!
The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard....
But while Dallas dropped to it knees as a team, they ALL stood up for our National Anthem.
Big progress being made - we love our country!
But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem.
Big progress being made-we all love our country!
Luther Strange has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement.
Finish the job - vote today for "Big Luther".
Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier: 1994 - 2017.
Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea.
Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc.
We are working hard.
The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations.
The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!
ALABAMA, get out and vote for Luther Strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down!
Honored to welcome Republican and Democrat members of the House Ways and Means Committee to the White House today!
Heading over to the @UN to meet with Ambassador @NikkiHaley and all of her great representatives!
I want to express our support and extend our prayers to all those affected by the vile terror attack in Spain last month.
It was an honor to welcome President @MarianoraJoy of Spain.
Thank you to our wonderful team @USUN and their families.
Keep up the GREAT work!
Great history of advising Presidents-then & now!
Thanks NSC Staff!
Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!
Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama.
Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race.
Roy, WIN in Nov!
Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama.
Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race.
Roy, WIN in Dec!
Spoke to Roy Moore of Alabama last night for the first time.
Sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race.
Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday.
Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done.
Players will stand for Country!
With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!
We will have the votes for Healthcare but not for the reconciliation deadline of Friday, after which we need 60.
Get rid of Filibuster Rule!
Facebook was always anti-Trump.
The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) & @WaPo were anti-Trump.
Collusion?
But the people were Pro-Trump!
This is the right TAX CUT @ the RIGHT TIME.
We will ALL succeed & grow TOGETHER – as one team, one people, & one American family.
It is time to take care of OUR people, to rebuild OUR NATION, and to fight for OUR GREAT AMERICAN WORKERS!
Democrats don't want massive tax cuts - how does that win elections?
Great reviews for Tax Cut and Reform Bill.
The electric power grid in Puerto Rico is totally shot.
Large numbers of generators are now on Island.
Food and water on site.
Welcome back @SteveScalise!
FEMA & First Responders are doing a GREAT job in Puerto Rico.
Massive food & water delivered.
Docks & electric grid dead.
Locals trying eally hard to help but many have lost their homes.
Military is now on site and I will be there Tuesday.
Wish press would treat fairly!
Puerto Rico is devastated.
Phone system, electric grid many roads, gone.
FEMA and First Responders are amazing.
Governor said "great job"!
GDP was revised upward to 3.1 for last quarter.
Many people thought it would be years before that happened.
We have just begun!
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello just stated: "The Administration and the President, every time we've spoken, they've delivered  fact is that Puerto Rico has been destroyed by two hurricanes.
Big decisions will have to be made as to the cost of its rebuilding!
Thank you to FEMA, our great Military & all First Responders who are working so hard,against terrible odds,in Puerto Rico.
See you Tuesday!
This week we came one step closer to reaching the goal of aligning the skills taught in our nation’s classrooms with the jobs of the future.
Thank you @ShopFloorNAM.
An honor to be with you today.
Great news!
Manufacturers report record-high economic optimism in 2017.
My thoughts are with all those observing Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year.
The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump....
Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.
They ant everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.
The military and first responders, despite no electric, roads, phones etc.
, have done an amazing job.
Puerto Rico was totally destroyed.
Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to "get Trump".
Not fair to FR or effort!
I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday with Melania.
Will hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands (people working hard).
The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's.
Shame!
Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico.
Great people!
The Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, is a great guy and leader who is really working hard.
Thank you Ricky!
Congresswoman Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico has been wonderful to deal with and a great representative of the people.
Thank you!
My Administration, Governor @RicardoRossello, and many others are working together to help the people of Puerto Rico in every way...
We must all be united in offering assistance to everyone suffering in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the wake of this terrible disaster.
Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor.
Doing everything we can to help great people of PR!
I will be in PR on Tues.
to further ensure we continue doing everything possible to assist & support the people in their time of great need.
Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem.
Respect our Flag and our Country!
In analyzing the Alabama Primary race, Fake News always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after Election!
In analyzing the Alabama Primary race,FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement!
We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico.
Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates, people are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by FEMA and our great Military.
All buildings now inspected r safety.
Thank you to the Governor of P.R. and to all of those who are working so closely with our First Responders.
Fantastic job!
I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!
Being nice to Rocket Man hasn't worked in 25 years, why would it work now?
Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed.
I won't fail.
My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting.
God bless you!
I am so proud of our great Country.
God bless America!
Leaving Puerto Rico now for D.C. Will be in Las Vegas early tomorrow to pay my respects.
Everyone is in my thoughts and prayers.
So proud of @FEMA, Military, and First Responders!
Thank you!
It is a "miracle" how fast the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were able to find the demented shooter and stop him from even more killing!
My Administration will continue to work around the clock with Governor @RicardoRossello & his team.
Great progress being made!
A great day in Puerto Rico yesterday.
While some of the news coverage is Fake, most showed great warmth and friendship.
Wow, so many Fake News stories today.
No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak truth.
The Fake News Media is out of control!
The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec.
Tillerson and @VP Pence.
I will be landing in Las Vegas shortly to pay my respects with @FLOTUS Melania.
Everyone remains in our thoughts and prayers.
WE LOVE YOU LAS VEGAS!
On behalf of a GRATEFUL NATION, THANK YOU to all of the First Responders (HEROES) who saved countless lives in Las Vegas on Sunday night.
So wonderful to be in Las Vegas yesterday and meet with people, from police to doctors to the victims themselves, who I will never forget!
Thank you!
Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE!
Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high!
Unemployment lowest in 16 years!
Business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!
Rex Tillerson never threatened to resign.
This is Fake News put out by @NBCNews.
Low news and reporting standards.
No verification from me.
Ralph Northam,who is running for Governor of Virginia,is fighting for the violent MS-13 killer gangs & sanctuary cities.
Vote Ed Gillespie!
Can't believe I finally got a good story in the @washingtonpost.
It discusses the enthusiasm of "Trump" voters through campaign ontributions.
The RNC is taking in far more $'s than the Dems, and much of it by my wonderful small donors.
I am working hard for them!
Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very "unfunny" & repetitive material, always anti-Trump!
Should we get Equal Time?
More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill.
ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums.
Who knows!
@NBCNews is so knowingly inaccurate with their reporting.
The good news is that the PEOPLE get it, which is really all that matters!
Will be joining @GovMikeHuckabee tonight at 8pmE on @TBN.
Enjoy!
Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid n't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators.
Sorry, but only one thing will work!
Thanks for your support!
Leaving the White House for the Great State of North Carolina.
Big progress being made on many fronts!
Senator Bob Corker "begged" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee.
I said "NO" and he dropped out (said he could not win without.....
my endorsement).
He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said "NO THANKS".
He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!
Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda.
Didn't have the guts to run!
I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country.
I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.
FEMA and first responders are working hard (yet again) on Hurricane Nate.
Military helping.
Very much under control!
Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it.
We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!
Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing.
Policy didn't work!
The trip by @VP Pence was long planned.
He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!
A big salute to Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag".
Stand for Anthem or sit for game"!
We have just begun!
Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country?
Change tax law!
With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have "tanked," in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!
Highly respected author, Christopher Bedford, just came out with book, "The Art of the Donald, Lessons from America's...
".
Really good book!
The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation.
Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!
The Fake News is at it again, this time trying to hurt one of the finest people I know, General John Kelly, by saying he will soon be red.
This story is totally made up by the dishonest media.
The Chief is doing a FANTASTIC job for me and, more importantly, for the USA!
Stock Market has increased by 5.2 Trillion dollars since the election on November 8th, a 25% increase.
Lowest unemployment in 16 years and.....
if Congress gives us the massive tax cuts (and reform) I am asking for, those numbers will grow by leaps and bounds.
It would be really nice if the Fake News Media would report the virtually unprecedented Stock Market growth since the election.
The Democrats want MASSIVE tax increases & soft, crime producing borders.
The Republicans want the biggest tax cut in history & the WALL!
Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a "tenfold" increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal.
Pure fiction, made up to demean.
NBC = CNN!
With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License?
Bad for country!
Happy to announce we are awarding $1M to Las Vegas - in order to help local law enforcement working OT to respond to last Sunday’s tragedy.
Join me LIVE at 5:45pmE from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania!
I will be interviewed tonight on @FoxNews by @SeanHannity at 9pmE.
Enjoy!
Joining @SeanHannity tonight at 9pmE on @FoxNews.
Enjoy!
Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.
Not fair to public!
In even the darkest moments, the light of our people has shown through their goodness, their courage and their love.
Clips from tax speech and @seanhannity on @foxandfriends now.
Have a great day!
The Fake News Is going all out in order to demean and denigrate!
Such hatred!
The time has come to take action to IMPROVE access, INCREASE choices, and LOWER COSTS for HEALTHCARE!
We need a tax system that is FAIR to working FAMILIES & that encourages companies to STAY in AMERICA, GROW in AMERICA, and HIRE in AMERICA!
People are just now starting to find out how dishonest and disgusting (FakeNews) @NBCNews is.
Viewers beware.
May be worse than even @CNN!
It is time to take care of OUR COUNTRY, to rebuild OUR COMMUNITIES, and to protect our GREAT AMERICAN WORKERS!
The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding.
Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped.
Dems should call me to fix!
Sadly, they and others are Fake News, and the public is just beginning to figure it out!
ObamaCare is a broken mess.
Piece by piece we will now begin the process of giving America the great HealthCare it deserves!
The wonderful people of Puerto Rico, with their unmatched spirit, know how bad things were before the H's.
I will always be with them!
I have no greater privilege than to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the incredible men and women @USNavy!
In America, we don't worship government - we worship God.
Today, I announced our strategy to confront the Iranian regime’s hostile actions and to ensure that they never acquire a nuclear weapon.
Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders.
I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts.
Many people talking, with much agreement, on my Iran speech today.
Participants in the deal are making lots of money on trade with Iran!
Money pouring into Insurance Companies profits, under the guise of ObamaCare, is over.
They have made a fortune.
Dems must get smart & deal!
ObamaCare is causing such grief and tragedy for so many.
It is being dismantled but in the meantime, premiums & deductibles are way up!
Such a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs.
"We take up what may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history".
Health Insurance stocks, which have gone through the roof during the ObamaCare years, plunged yesterday after I ended their Dems windfall!
Very proud of my Executive Order which will allow greatly expanded access and far lower costs for HealthCare.
Millions of people benefit!
The Democrats in the Southwest part of Virginia have been abandoned by their Party.
Republican Ed Gillespie will never let you down!
The Failing @nytimes, in a story by Peter Baker, should have mentioned the rapid terminations by me of TPP & The Paris Accord & the fast pprovals of The Keystone XL & Dakota Access pipelines.
Also, look at the recent EPA cancelations & our great new Supreme Court Justice!
Art Laffer just said that he doesn't know how a Democrat could vote against the big tax cut/reform bill and live with themselves!
The Democrats only want to increase taxes and obstruct.
That's all they are good at!
Dem Senator Schumer hated the Iran deal made by President Obama, but now that I am involved, he is OK with it.
Tell that to Israel, Chuck!
The U.S. has gained more than 5.2 trillion dollars in Stock Market Value since Election Day!
Also, record business enthusiasm.
I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020?
My answer was, "I hope so"!
Always great to see the wonderful people of South Carolina.
Thank you for the beautiful welcome at Greenville-Spartanburg Int'l Airport!
Rep.
Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar.
Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!
Join me LIVE from the Rose Garden at 1:30pmE with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece.
It was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece to the WH today!
So much Fake News being put in dying magazines and newspapers.
Only place worse may be @NBCNews, @CBSNews, @ABC and @CNN.
Fiction writers!
Any increase in ObamaCare premiums is the fault of the Democrats for giving us a "product" that never had a chance of working.
BORDER WALL prototypes underway!
WOW!
Thank you @Heritage!
This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalize our economy, revive our industry & renew the AMERICAN DREAM!
The most important truth our FOUNDERS understood was: FREEDOM is NOT a gift from Govt.
FREEDOM is a GIFT from GOD.
Wow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating  Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete.
Many.....
people not interviewed, including Clinton herself.
Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix?
Where is Justice Dept?
The Democrats will only vote for Tax Increases.
Hopefully, all Senate Republicans will vote for the largest Tax Cuts in U.S. history.
As it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton.
He was the best thing that ever happened to her!
The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem.
Total disrespect for our great country!
Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof).
Sad!
I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care.
The current tax code is a burden on American taxpayers & harmful to job-creators.
Our hearts are with all affected by the wildfires in California.
God bless our brave First Responders and @FEMA team.
We support you!
It was an honor to welcome Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee to the @WhiteHouse today..
@NFL: Too much talk, not enough action.
Stand for the National Anthem.
This is what REAL PRIDE in our COUNTRY is all about!
@DanaPerino & @BradThor, Thank you so much for the wonderful compliment.
Working hard!
Republicans are going for the big Budget approval today, first step toward massive tax cuts.
I think we have the votes, but who knows?
Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!
Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th.
Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?
Keep up the GREAT work.
I am with you 100%!
"ISIS is losing its grip..
".
The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!
Great news on the 2018 budget @SenateMajLdr McConnell - first step toward delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for the American people!
The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49.
We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against his now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!
Just out report: "United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror".
Not good, we must keep America safe!
Thank you @GeraldoRivera @FoxandFriends.
Agree!
Today, it was an honor to have @UN Secretary-General @AntonioGuterres at the @WhiteHouse.
Speaking for the U.S.A., we appreciate all you do!
This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to offer historic tax relief to the American people!
Great book just out, "A Place Called Heaven," by Dr. Robert Jeffress - A wonderful man!
Budget that just passed is a really big deal, especially in terms of what will be the biggest tax cut in U.S. history - MSM barely covered!
I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party!
Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.
People get what is going on!
Stock Market hits another all time high on Friday.
Fake News doesn't spent much time on this!
Officials behind the now discredited "Dossier" plead the Fifth.
Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.
Keep hearing about "tiny" amount of money spent on Facebook ads.
What about the billions of dollars of Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC & CBS?
Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did.
Facebook was on her side, not mine!
Just out, but lightly reported: "Fewest jobless claims since 1973 show firm U.S. Job Market" Lowest since March 1973.
I agree getting Tax Cuts approved  is important (we will also get HealthCare), but perhaps no Administration has done more in its first months than this Administration.
Over 50 Legislation approvals, massive regulation cuts, energy freedom, pipelines, border security nd Amendment, Strong Military, ISIS, historic VA improvement, Supreme Court Justice, Record Stock Market, lowest unemployment in 17 yrs!
Doing interview today with Maria Bartiromo at 10:00 A.M. on @FoxNews - ENJOY!
Wacky Congresswoman Wilson is the gift that keeps on giving for the Republican Party, a disaster for Dems.
You watch her in action & vote R!
It is finally sinking through.
FAKE NEWS, even worse!
Lost cred.
There will be NO change to your 401(k).
This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!
Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country.
No leadership in NFL!
I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt.
La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!
We will never forget the 241 American service members killed by Hizballah in Beirut.
They died in service to our nation.
Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts orker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump.
Look at his record!
Isn't it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker, who couldn't get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee, will now fight Tax Cuts plus!
Sen.
Corker is the incompetent head of the Foreign Relations Committee, & look how poorly the U.S. has done.
He doesn't have a clue as e entire World WAS laughing and taking advantage of us.
People like liddle' Bob Corker have set the U.S. way back.
Now we move forward!
Stock Market just hit another record high!
Jobs looking very good.
So nice being with Republican Senators today.
Multiple standing ovations!
The reason Flake and Corker dropped out of the Senate race is very simple, they had zero chance of being elected.
Now act so hurt & wounded!
The meeting with Republican Senators yesterday, outside of Flake and Corker, was a love fest with standing ovations and great ideas for USA!
Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history.
Great support from so many sides.
Jeff Flake, with an 18% approval rating in Arizona, said "a lot of my colleagues have spoken out".
Really, they just gave me a standing O!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Congrats to @Reince Priebus, a really good and talented man.
We’re proud of you Reince!
Just interviewed by @LouDobbs.
Will be aired tonight at 7pmE on @FoxBusiness.
Spoke to President Xi of China to congratulate him on his extraordinary elevation.
Also discussed NoKo & trade, two very important subjects!
Melania and I look forward to being with President Xi & Madame Peng Liyuan in China in two weeks for what will hopefully be a historic trip!
Texas @GovAbbott & Lt.
Gov.
@DanPatrick, Thank you for todays briefing on hurricane recovery efforts here in TX.
Keep up the great work!
Interview with @LouDobbs coming up at 7pmE on @FoxBusiness.
Enjoy!
This will be the biggest TAX CUT in the history of our country - and we need it!
Together, we will Make America Great Again!
Will be another Sean success!
Ed Gillespie will be a great Governor of Virginia.
His opponent doesn't even show up to meetings/work, and will be VERY weak on crime!
Do not underestimate the UNITY within the Republican Party!
Big news - Budget just passed!
Wacky & totally unhinged Tom Steyer, who has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from beginning, never wins elections!
Thank you @foxandfriends.
Really great job and show!
Congratulations to @SpeakerRyan, @GOPLeader, @SteveScalise and to the Republican Party on Budget passage yesterday.
Good luck to @Joy_Villa on her decision to enter the wonderful world of politics.
She has many fans!
Happy birthday to the great @leegreenwood83.
You and your beautiful song have made such a difference.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
JFK Files are being carefully released.
In the end there will be great transparency.
It is my hope to get just about everything to public!
Happy birthday to the great @TheLeeGreenwood.
You and your beautiful song have made such a difference.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump.
Was collusion with HC!
Thank you @FLGovScott.
We are inspired by the stories of everyday heroes who pull their communities from the depths of despair through leadership and love..
People are anxiously awaiting my decision as to who the next head of the Fed will be....
Happy Birthday @TheLeeGreenwood!
Very little reporting about the GREAT GDP numbers announced yesterday (3.0 despite the big hurricane hits).
Best consecutive Q's in years!
Just read the nice remarks by President Jimmy Carter about me and how badly I am treated by the press (Fake News).
Thank you Mr. President!
Today is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.
While not at all presidential I must point out that the Sloppy Michael Moore Show on Broadway was a TOTAL BOMB and was forced to close.
Sad!
JFK Files are released, long ahead of schedule!
As usual, the ObamaCare premiums will be up (the Dems own it), but we will Repeal & Replace and have great Healthcare soon after Tax Cuts!
Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?
), he Uranium to Russia deal, the  33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more.
Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia, collusion," which doesn't exist.
The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's are now fighting back like never before.
There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out.
DO SOMETHING!
All of this "Russia" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform.
Is this coincidental?
NOT!
Report out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS.
The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?
) from DNC.
Nobody knows who OK'd!
Great job by MichaelCaputo on @foxandfriends.
Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.
But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????
Also, there is NO COLLUSION!
The Fake News is working overtime.
As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was "no collusion" and events mentioned took place long before he .
came to the campaign.
Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.
Check the DEMS!
I hope people will start to focus on our Massive Tax Cuts for Business (jobs) and the Middle Class (in addition to Democrat corruption)!
The biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm.
What he know about Crooked Dems is earth shattering.
He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled.
Fake News weak!
Thank you @LuisRiveraMarin!
Wishing everyone a safe and Happy Halloween!
In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person.
Law enforcement is following this closely.
NOT IN THE U.S.A.!
We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere.
Enough!
My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack.
God and your country are with you!
The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve.
These will be biggest ever!
I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.
Being politically correct is fine, but not for this!
The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program," a Chuck Schumer beauty.
I want merit based.
We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems.
We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).
Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts or the Middle Class.
The House and Senate should consider ASAP as the process of final approval moves along.
We mourn the horrifying terrorist attack in NYC.
All of America is praying and grieving for the families who lost their precious loved ones.
Just spoke with @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor de Blasio to let them know that the federal government...
Thank you to the GREAT NYPD, First Responders and all govt officials for having handled the terrible West Side attack so professionally!
Thanks to @SenateMajLdr McConnell and the @SenateGOP we are appointing high-quality Federal District...
CHAIN MIGRATION must end now!
Some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil.
NOT ACCEPTABLE!
Just spoke to President Macri of Argentina about the five proud and wonderful men killed in the West Side terror attack.
God be with them!
The United States will be immediately implementing much tougher Extreme Vetting Procedures.
The safety of our citizens comes first!
It is finally happening for our great clean coal miners!
Happy birthday to @garyplayer, a truly great Champion and Person!
Great mtg w/ @Cabinet today.
Tomorrow, I will be announcing the new head of the Fed.
I think you will be extremely impressed by this person!
NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He killed 8 people, badly injured 12.
SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!
Would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed.
Should move fast.
DEATH PENALTY!
I am calling on Congress to TERMINATE the diversity visa lottery program that presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security.
Congress must end chain migration so that we can have a system that is SECURITY BASED!
We need to make AMERICA SAFE!
Today, we are thrilled to welcome @Broadcom CEO Hock Tan to the WH to announce he is moving their HQ’s from Singapore back to the U.S.A.....
Broadcom's move to America=$20 BILLION of annual rev into U.S.A., $3+ BILLION/yr.
in research/engineering & $6 BILLION/yr.
in manufacturing.
Today, it was my pleasure and great honor to announce my nomination of Jerome Powell to be the next Chairman of the @FederalReserve.
Great Tax Cut rollout today.
The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!
Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders.
Bought and paid for by Crooked H This is real collusion and dishonesty.
Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering - where is our Justice Department?
The @TuckerCarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great FBI was so sad to watch.
James Comey's leadership was a disaster!
I will be interviewed by @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews at 10:00.
Enjoy!
My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee.
I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.
Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems.....
New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary.
What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus .
People are angry.
At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper.
The American public deserves it!
The real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book.
Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!
Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries!
Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.
ISIS just claimed the Degenerate Animal who killed, and so badly wounded, the wonderful people on the West Side, was "their soldier".
sed on that, the Military has hit ISIS "much harder" over the last two days.
They will pay a big price for every attack on us!
Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!
I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders, not Crooked H, without cheating, I was right.
Just took off for ceremony @ Pearl Harbor.
Will then be heading to Japan, SKorea, China, Vietnam & the Philippines.
Will never let you down!
The rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night.
Disgraceful!
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.
Getting ready to land in Hawaii.
Looking so much forward to meeting with our great Military/Veterans at Pearl Harbor!
Thank you for such a beautiful welcome Hawaii.
My great honor to visit @PacificCommand upon arrival.
Heading to Pearl Harbor w/ @FLOTUS now.
Thank you to our GREAT Military/Veterans and @PacificCommand.
Unemployment is down to 4.1%, lowest in 17 years.
Highest stock Market ever, up $5.
Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange.
Important to the United States!
I am landing shortly.
Can’t wait to be with our GREAT MILITARY.
See you soon!
Just gave a speech to the great men and women at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, Japan.
Leaving to see Prime Minister Abe.
Playing golf with Prime Minister Abe and Hideki Matsuyama, two wonderful people!
It was a true honor to be at Yokota Air Base with our GREAT @USForcesJapan!
Heading into the 12 days with great negotiating strength because of our tremendous economy.
May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.
The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene.
I am monitoring the situation from Japan....
Americans do what we do best: we pull together.
We join hands.
We lock arms and through the tears and the sadness, we stand strong...
The state of Virginia economy, under Democrat rule, has been terrible.
If you vote Ed Gillespie tomorrow, it will come roaring back!
My visit to Japan and friendship with PM Abe will yield many benefits, for our great Country.
Massive military & energy orders happening+++!
Getting ready to leave for South Korea and meetings with President Moon, a fine gentleman.
We will figure it all out!
I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing Some of those they are harshly treating have been “milking” their country for years!
It was my great honor to have lunch with our INCREDIBLE U.S. and ROK troops at Camp Humphreys, in South Korea.
Thank you to President Moon of South Korea for the beautiful welcoming ceremony.
It will always be remembered.
Stock market hit yet another all-time record high yesterday.
There is great confidence in the moves that my Administration is making.
Working very hard on TAX CUTS for the middle class, companies and jobs!
Ralph Northam will allow crime to be rampant in Virginia.
He’s weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS, Anti-Second Amendment and has been horrible on Virginia economy.
Vote @EdWGillespie today!
@EdWGillespie will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of VA.
MS-13 and crime will be gone.
Vote today, ASAP!
Franklin, such a great photo.
HAPPY 99th BIRTHDAY to your father, @BillyGraham!
Thank you to all Americans who participated in Nat'l Rx Drug Take Back Day.
A record amount of drugs collected & disposed.
We can do this!
Getting ready to make a major speech to the National Assembly here in South Korea, then will be headed to China where I very much look forward to meeting with President Xi who is just off his great political victory.
Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.
Don’t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!
The U.S., under my administration, is completely rebuilding its military, and they're spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world, being built right now.
I want peace through strength!
The North Korean regime has pursued its nuclear & ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance, agreement, & commmitment it has made to the U.S. and its allies.
It's broken all of those commitments...
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the U.S. should look to our past....
and you will doubt it no longer.
Together, we dream of a Korea that is free, a peninsula that is safe, and families that are reunited once again!
Leaving South Korea now heading to China.
Looking very much forward to meeting and being with President Xi!
On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and I, THANK YOU for an unforgettable afternoon and evening at the Forbidden City in Beijing, President Xi and Madame Peng Liyuan.
We are looking forward to rejoining you tomorrow morning!
NoKo has interpreted America's past restraint as weakness.
This would be a fatal miscalculation.
Do not underestimate us.
AND DO NOT TRY US.
Looking forward to a full day of meetings with President Xi and our delegations tomorrow.
THANK YOU for the beautiful welcome China!
@FLOTUS Melania and I will never forget it!
Congratulations to all of the ”DEPLORABLES” and the millions of people who gave us a MASSIVE (304-227) Electoral College landslide victory!
President Xi, thank you for such an incredible welcome ceremony.
It was a truly memorable and impressive display!
In the coming months and years ahead I look forward to building an even STRONGER relationship between the United States and China.
I don’t blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100's of billions.
How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue?
I would've done same!
My meetings with President Xi Jinping were very productive on both trade and the subject of North Korea.
He is a highly respected and powerful representative of his people.
It was great being with him and Madame Peng Liyuan!
Throughout my travels, I've had the pleasure of sharing the good news from America.
I've had the honor of sharing our vision for a free & open Indo-Pacific -- a place where sovereign & independent nations, w/diverse cultures & many different dreams, can all prosper side-by-side.
In more and more places throughout this region, citizens of SOVEREIGN and INDEPENDENT nations have taken greater control of their destinies, and unlocked the potential of their people.
Today I am here to offer a renewed partnership with America -- to work together to strengthen the bonds of friendship and commerce between all of the nations of the Indo-Pacific, and together, to promote our prosperity and security.
The United States is prepared to work with each of the leaders in this room today to achieve mutually beneficial commerce that is in the interests of both your countries and mine.
That is the message I am here to deliver today.
The United States has been reminded time and again in recent years that economic security is not merely RELATED to national security -economic security IS national security.
It is vital to our national strength.
The United States has been reminded time and again in recent years that economic security is not merely RELATED to national security - economic security IS national security.
It is vital to our national strength.
On behalf of an entire nation, Happy 242nd Birthday to the men and women of the United States Marines!
On this wonderful Veterans Day, I want to express the incredible gratitude of the entire American Nation to our GREAT VETERANS.
Thank you!
Will be doing a joint press conference in Hanoi, Vietnam then heading for final destination of trip, the Phillipines.
When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.
There always playing politics - bad for our country.
I want to solve North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, terrorism, and Russia can greatly help!
Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button?
Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin.
Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat"?
Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!
Just landed in the Philippines after a great day of meetings and events in Hanoi, Vietnam!
Just landed in the Philippines after a great day of meetings and events in Hanoi, Vietnam!
We had a wonderful visit to Vietnam, thank you President Tran Dai Quang!
Thank you!
Happy to announce, I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary.
He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!
I am proud of the Rep.
House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.
} We’re getting close!
Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further?
Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?
Excited to be heading home to see the House pass a GREAT Tax Bill with the middle class getting big TAX CUTS!
Great to see @RandPaul looking well and back on the Senate floor.
He will help us with TAX CUTS and REFORM!
After my tour of Asia, all Countries dealing with us on TRADE know that the rules have changed.
The United States has to be treated fairly and in a reciprocal fashion.
The massive TRADE deficits must go down quickly!
I will be making a major statement from the @WhiteHouse upon my return to D.C. Time and date to be set.
One of the most accurate polls last time around.
THANK YOU to the amazing staff and their families of the United States Embassy in the Philippines.
Keep up the GREAT WORK!
THANK YOU ASIA!
May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.
The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived.
Just returned from Asia after 12 very successful days.
Great to be home!
Our great country is respected again in Asia.
You will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!
@foxandfriends will be showing much of our successful trip to Asia, and the friendships & benefits that will endure for years to come!
While in the Philippines I was forced to watch @CNN, which I have not done in months, and again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is.
Loser!
Thank you, working hard!
Thank you!
Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump?
They were headed for 10 years in jail!
The failing @nytimes hates the fact that I have developed a great relationship with World leaders like Xi Jinping, President of China ey should realize that these relationships are a good thing, not a bad thing.
The U.S. is being respected again.
Watch Trade!
It is actually hard to believe how naive (or dumb) the Failing @nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy...
weak and ineffective!
Why are Democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business (jobs)?
The reason: Obstruction and Delay!
Big vote tomorrow in the House.
Tax cuts are getting close!
To the three UCLA basketball players I say:  You're welcome, go out and give a big Thank You to President Xi Jinping of China who made our release possible and, HAVE A GREAT LIFE!
Be careful, there are many pitfalls on the long and winding road of life!
China is sending an Envoy and Delegation to North Korea - A big move, we'll see what happens!
Need all on the UN Security Council to vote to renew the Joint Investigative Mechanism for Syria to ensure that Assad Regime does not commit mass murder with chemical weapons ever again.
Big win today in the House for GOP Tax Cuts and Reform, 227-205.
Zero Dems, they want to raise taxes much higher, but not for our military!
The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words.
Where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps?
And to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women.
Lesley Stahl tape?
Great numbers on Stocks and the Economy.
If we get Tax Cuts and Reform, we'll really see some great results!
If Democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes, we would be able to get many of their ideas into Bill!
Today, it was an honor to celebrate the Collegiate National Champions of 2016/2017 at the @WhiteHouse!
Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts.
Under study for years.
Will update soon with Secretary Zinke.
Thank you!
Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time.
She just can’t stop, which is so good for the Republican Party.
Hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three years!
Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal.
I should have left them in jail!
Sen.
Jeff Flake(y), who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite President.
He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast”.
Shoplifting is a very big deal in China, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father LaVar.
Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead.
China told them why they were released.
Very ungrateful!
Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.
Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border, another badly hurt.
We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible.
We will, and must, build the Wall!
Republican Senators are working very hard to get Tax Cuts and Tax Reform approved.
Hopefully it will not be long and they do not want to disappoint the American public!
Marshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem.
Great disrespect!
Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season.
Attendance and ratings way down.
Under President Trump unemployment rate will drop below 4%.
Analysts predict economic boom for 2018!
President Donald J. Trump and @FLOTUS Melania Participate in the Pardoning of the National Thanksgiving Turkey at the White House.
Today, we continued a wonderful American Tradition at the White House.
Drumstick and Wishbone will live out their days in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains at Gobbler’s Rest...
It wasn’t the White House, it wasn’t the State Department, it wasn’t father LaVar’s so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - IT WAS ME.
Too bad!
LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair.
Just think.....
LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you.
But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing.
It’s a really big deal, especially in China.
Ungrateful fool!
The NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season.
That’s almost as bad as kneeling!
When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart?
This issue is killing your league!
Another Crooked Hillary Fan!
Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago).
Stock Market hit new Record High yesterday - $5.5 trillion gain since E. Many companies coming back to the U.S. Military building up and getting very strong.
The @USNavy is conducting search and rescue following aircraft crash.
We are monitoring the situation.
Prayers for all involved.
Traffic and airports are running very smoothly!
I have long given the order to help Argentina with the Search and Rescue mission of their missing submarine.
May God be with them and the people of Argentina!
And it will get even better with Tax Cuts!
HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well.
Jobs coming back, highest Stock Market EVER, Military getting really strong, we will build the WALL, V.A. taking care of our Vets, great Supreme Court Justice, RECORD CUT IN REGS, lowest unemployment in 17 years....!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Will be doing a live Thanksgiving Video Teleconference with Members of the Military at 9:00 A.M.  Afghanistan, Iraq, USS Monterey, Turkey & Bahrain.
Then going to Coast Guard Quarters, Florida.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING!
My great honor to join our incredible men and women of the @USCG, at the Lake Worth Inlet Station, in Riviera Beach, Florida today!
ObamaCare premiums are going up, up, up, just as I have been predicting for two years.
ObamaCare is OWNED by the Democrats, and it is a disaster.
But do not worry.
Even though the Dems want to Obstruct, we will Repeal & Replace right after Tax Cuts!
A great guy (with great ratings)!
Two great people!
Can you believe that the disrespect for our Country, our Flag, our Anthem continues without penalty to the players.
The Commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league.
Players are the boss!
Will be speaking to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that I inherited in the Middle East.
I will get it all done, but what a mistake, in lives and dollars (6 trillion), to be there in the first place!
After Turkey call I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, to play golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson.
Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!
Horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in Egypt.
The world cannot tolerate terrorism, we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!
Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack, with so much loss of life.
We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will.
Need the WALL, need the BAN!
God bless the people of Egypt.
Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named “Man (Person) of the Year,” like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot.
I said probably is no good and took a pass.
Thanks anyway!
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick.
Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public.
We will bring it back to life!
Check out the recent Editorial in the Wall Street Journal @WSJ about what a complete disaster the @CFPB has been under its leader from previous Administration, who just quit!
@FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly.
The outside world does not see the truth from them!
Wow, even I didn’t realize we did so much.
Wish the Fake News would report!
Thank you.
The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY.
Jones would be a disaster!
I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary.
He shot way up in the polls but it wasn’t enough.
Can’t let Schumer/Pelosi win this race.
Liberal Jones would be BAD!
Since the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia,Russia.
Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Back in D.C., big week for Tax Cuts and many other things of great importance to our Country.
Senate Republicans will hopefully come through for all of us.
The Tax Cut Bill is getting better and better.
The end result will be great for ALL!
We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me).
They are all bad.
Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!
The good news is that their ratings are terrible, nobody cares!
The Tax Cut Bill is coming along very well, great support.
With just a few changes, some mathematical, the middle class and job producers can get even more in actual dollars and savings and the pass through provision becomes simpler and really works well!
New home sales reach a 10 year high.
Stock Market has more record gains.
Hopefully Republican Senators will give us the much needed Tax Cuts to keep it all going!
Democrats want big Tax Increases.
Thank you Rand!
At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up.
The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem.
Weak and out of control!
Melania, our great and very hard working First Lady, who truly loves what she is doing, always thought that “if you run, you will win”.
She would tell everyone that, “no doubt, he will win”.
I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) - and Country is doing great!
Meeting with “Chuck and Nancy” today about keeping government open and working.
Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes.
I don’t see a deal!
Remarks from the Roosevelt Room with @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell, @SpeakerRyan and Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis.
Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all finished the day at new RECORD HIGHS!
After North Korea missile launch, it's more important than ever to fund our gov't & military!
Dems shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty & illegal immigration.
I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big.
They can't now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.
Charles McCullough, the respected fmr Intel Comm Inspector General, said public was misled on Crooked Hillary Emails.
“Emails endangered National Security”.
Why aren’t our deep State authorities looking at this?
Rigged & corrupt?
Just won the lawsuit on leadership of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB.
A big win for the Consumer!
Great work Ivanka!
Great day for Tax Cuts and the Republican Party.
But the biggest Winner will be our great Country!
@foxandfriends, we are in record territory in all things having to do with our economy!
Great, and we should boycott Fake News CNN.
Dealing with them is a total waste of time!
Looks like another great day for the Stock Market.
Consumer Confidence is at Record High.
I guess somebody likes me (my policies)!
Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace”.
But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News.
Check out Andy Lack’s past!
So now tha Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin?
And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in Florida years ago?
Investigate!
So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin?
And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the “unsolved mystery” that took place in Florida years ago?
Investigate!
Just spoke to President XI JINPING of China concerning the provocative actions of North Korea.
Additional major sanctions will be imposed on North Korea today.
This situation will be handled!
Economy growing!
Excluding hurricane effects, CEA estimates that real GDP growth would have been 3.9% in Q3.
Stock market at a new high, unemployment at a low.
We are winning and TAX CUTS will shift our economy into high gear!
Departing @JBA_NAFW for St. Charles, Missouri to help push our plan for HISTORIC TAX CUTS across the finish line.
A successful vote in the Senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the American people!
This week, the Senate can join the House & take a strong stand for the Middle Class families who are the backbone of America.
Together, we will give the American people a big, beautiful Christmas present-a massive tax cut that lets Americans keep more of their HARD-EARNED MONEY!
A vote to CUT TAXES is a vote to PUT AMERICA FIRST.
It is time to take care of OUR WORKERS, to protect OUR COMMUNITIES, and to REBUILD OUR GREAT COUNTRY!
Now, we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to RESTORE AMERICAN PROSPERITY – and RECLAIM AMERICA’S DESTINY.
But in order to achieve this bright and glowing future, the SENATE MUST PASS TAX CUTS – and bring Main Street roaring back to life!
Theresa @theresamay, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.
We are doing just fine!
@Theresa_May, don’t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.
We are doing just fine!
The House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?
) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump.
Big stuff.
Deep State.
Give this information NOW!
The only people who don’t like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don’t understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans!
Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!
The Failing @nytimes, the pipe organ for the Democrat Party, has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill.
They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!
The Failing @nytimes has totally gone against the Social Media Guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went Rogue!
The Chinese Envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man.
Hard to believe his people, and the military, put up with living in such horrible conditions.
Russia and China condemned the launch.
Stock Market hits new Record High.
Confidence and enthusiasm abound.
More great numbers coming out!
The Dow just broke 24,000 for the first time (another all-time Record).
If the Dems had won the Presidential Election, the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence, which is also at an all-time high, would be “low and glum!
Thank you @SenOrrinHatch.
Let’s continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Today, it was my great honor to meet with the Crown Prince of Bahrain at the @WhiteHouse.
Bahrain and the United States are important partners.
During the Crown Prince’s visit, he is advancing $9 BILLION in commercial deals, including finalizing the purchase of F-16’s...
Our FIFTH 1K milestone of 2017!
Today is a day that I’ve been looking very much forward to ALL YEAR LONG.
It is one that you have heard me speak about many times before.
Now, as President of the United States, it is my tremendous honor to finally wish America and the world, a very MERRY CHRISTMAS!
The Christmas Story begins 2,000 years ago with a mother, a father, their baby son and the most extraordinary gift of all—the gift of God’s love for all of humanity.
Whatever our beliefs, we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of his life...
A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!
No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.
The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court.
His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice.
BUILD THE WALL!
The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon.
The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.
Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country.
The Bill is getting better and better.
This is a once in a generation chance.
Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!
The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS!
He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!
Economists on the TAX CUTS and JOBS ACT: “The enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will IGNITE our ECONOMY with levels of GROWTH not SEEN IN GENERATIONS..
”.
We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America.
Special thanks to @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate.
Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas!
Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate.
Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage.
Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!
I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.
He has pled guilty to those lies.
It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful.
There was nothing to hide!
Great job First Lady Melania!
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...
and nothing happens to her?
Rigged system, or just a double standard?
Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails?
No justice!
Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt.
More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake News!
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn.
Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
Such a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco!
Tainted (no, very dishonest?
) FBI “agent’s role in Clinton probe under review”.
Led Clinton Email probe.
@foxandfriends  Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.
After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History!
But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.
People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of @ABC News (he has been suspended), should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE”  Now it all starts to make sense!
Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama.
We need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, Border Wall, Military, Pro Life, V.A., Judges 2nd Amendment and more.
No to Jones, a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!
Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders...
& so much more.
Look at your 401-k’s since Election.
Highest Stock Market EVER!
Jobs are roaring back!
With the great vote on Cutting Taxes, this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!
A must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history.
Enjoy!
Yesterday, I was thrilled to be with so many WONDERFUL friends, in Utah’s MAGNIFICENT Capitol.
It was my honor to sign two Presidential Proclamations that will modify the national monuments designations of both Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante...
Join me this Friday in Pensacola, Florida at the Pensacola Bay Center!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone in the path of California’s wildfires.
I encourage everyone to heed the advice and orders of local and state officials.
THANK YOU to all First Responders for your incredible work!
I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem...
Go get the new book on Andrew Jackson by Brian Kilmeade...
Really good.
National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day - “A day that will live in infamy!
Today, our entire nation pauses to REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR—and the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for America.
God Bless our HEROES who wear the uniform, and God Bless the United States of America.
Today, the U.S. flag flies at half-staff at the @WhiteHouse, in honor of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.
Today, as we Remember Pearl Harbor, it was an incredible honor to be joined with surviving Veterans of the attack on 12/7/1941.
They are HEROES, and they are living witnesses to American History.
All American hearts are filled with gratitude for their service and their sacrifice.
Across the battlefields, oceans, and harrowing skies of Europe and the Pacific throughout the war, one great battle cry could be heard by America’s friends and foes alike: “REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR”.
I fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn’t!
Big crowd expected today in Pensacola, Florida, for a Make America Great Again speech.
We have done so much in so short a period of time...
and yet are planning to do so much more!
See you there!
LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already.
The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time.
He’s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns & Military.
VOTE ROY MOORE!
Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased.
I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
On my way to Pensacola, Florida.
See everyone soon!
Just arrived at the Pensacola Bay Center.
Join me LIVE on @FoxNews in 10 minutes!
This is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most.
So speak up, be heard, and fight, fight, fight for the change you've been waiting for your entire life!
MERRY CHRISTMAS and THANK YOU Pensacola, Florida!
We believe that every American should stand for the National Anthem, and we proudly pledge allegiance to one NATION UNDER GOD!
GREAT EVENING last night in Pensacola, Florida.
Arena was packed to the rafters, the crowd was loud, loving and really smart.
They definitely get what’s going on.
Thank you Pensacola!
A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night.
We can’t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat, Jones, in that important Alabama Senate seat.
Need your vote to Make America Great Again!
Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country.
Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday.
They were caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”).
Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?
CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS.
Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public.
There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN.
Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!
Heading to the great state of Mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected Governor, @PhilBryantMS.
Look forward to seeing the new Civil Rights Museum!
It was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the Mississippi State History Museum & the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.
We pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past & dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice & peace.
Have a great game today, @USArmy and @USNavy - I will be watching.
We love our U.S. Military.
On behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service!
@DaveWeigel @WashingtonPost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived @ the venue, w/ thousands of people outside, on their way in.
Real photos now shown as I spoke.
Packed house, many people unable to get in.
Demand apology & retraction from FAKE NEWS WaPo!
@daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?
) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when, in fact, he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.).
FAKE NEWS, he should be fired.
Great Army - Navy Game.
Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY (last time was 1996).
Wow!
Congratulations!
Great Army - Navy Game.
Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY!
Congratulations!
No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country.
Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans – not for criminal aliens!
Things are going really well for our economy, a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing!
Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH, unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA.
Really good news, and much more to come!
Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill.
Shaping up even better than projected.
House and Senate working very hard and smart.
End result will be not only important, but SPECIAL!
Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media.
They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them.
Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...
a stain on America!
Another false story, this time in the Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong!
Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News.
I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the “dumbest man on television!
” Bad Reporting.
Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don’t know and/or have never met.
FAKE NEWS!
Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.
Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!
The people of Alabama will do the right thing.
Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion, weak on Crime, Military and Illegal Immigration, Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL.
Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet.
Roy Moore will always vote with us.
VOTE ROY MOORE!
Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High, along with a Record High Stock Market.
Unemployment is at a 17 year low.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).
Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory.
The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win.
The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.
It never ends!
The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election.
I was right!
Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
Wow, more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories.
Hence my use of Social Media, the only way to get the truth out.
Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke!
If last night’s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate.
Thank you Omarosa for your service!
I wish you continued success.
Republican Tax Cuts are looking very good.
All are working hard.
In the meantime, the Stock Market hit another record high!
As a candidate, I promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday, working Americans.
If you make your voices heard, this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning – the dawn of a brilliant American future shining with PATRIOTISM, PROSPERITY AND PRIDE!
Today, we gathered in the Roosevelt Room for one single reason: to CUT THE RED TAPE!
For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regs, rules, and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, & devastated entire industries.
When Americans are free to thrive, innovate, & prosper, there is no challenge too great, no task too large, & no goal beyond our reach.
We are a nation of explorers, pioneers, innovators & inventors.
We are nation of people who work hard, dream big, & who never, ever give up...
In 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations.
Today there are over 185,000 pages, as seen in the Roosevelt Room.
Today, we CUT THE RED TAPE!
It is time to SET FREE OUR DREAMS and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
It was my honor.
THANK YOU!
To each member of the graduating class from the National Academy at Quantico, CONGRATULATIONS!
You are always there for us – THE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE.
Thank you to our police, thank you to our sheriffs, and thank you to our law enforcement families.
God Bless you all, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!
Today, it was my tremendous honor to visit Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) at the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
I am honored to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.
On behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service.
We love you!
DOW, S&P 500 and NASDAQ close at record highs!
Great job Kevin, we are all proud of you!
Congratulations to two great and hardworking guys, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, on the success of their just out book, “Let Trump Be Trump”.
Finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign!
TAX CUTS will increase investment in the American economy and in U.S. workers, leading to higher growth, higher wages, and more JOBS!
As a candidate, I promised we would pass a massive TAX CUT for the everyday working American families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country.
Now, we are just days away...
Wonderful weekend at Camp David.
A very special place.
A lot of very important work done.
Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now.
Remember, Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional Races this year.
The media refuses to mention this.
I said Gillespie and Moore would lose (for very different reasons), and they did.
I also predicted  “I” would win.
Republicans will do well in 2018, very well!
Ivanka Trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends.
The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly.
Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble!
Not for long!
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in DuPont, Washington.
Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene.
We are currently monitoring here at the White House.
Our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers are with the victims of the train derailment in Washington State.
We are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities...
Over the past 11 months, I have travelled tens of thousands of miles, to visit 13 countries.
I have met with more than 100 world leaders and everywhere I traveled, it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the AMERICAN PEOPLE!
When the American People speak, ALL OF US should listen.
Just over one year ago, you spoke loud and clear.
On November 8, 2016, you voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
As the world watches, we are days away from passing HISTORIC TAX CUTS for American families and businesses.
It will be the BIGGEST TAX CUT and TAX REFORM in the HISTORY of our country!
So true Ivanka!
Thank you Maria B!
We have NEVER had 70 Dow Records in a one year period.
Wow!
With the strategy that I announced today, we are declaring that AMERICA is in the game and AMERICA is DETERMINED to WIN!
Together, our task is to strengthen our families, to build up our communities, to serve our citizens, and to celebrate AMERICAN GREATNESS as a shining example to the world....
DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size.
Immediate expensing will have a big impact.
Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed.
Enjoy, and create many beautiful JOBS!
A  story in the @washingtonpost that I was close to “rescinding” the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS.
I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The unnamed sources don’t exist!
Congratulations to Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady, Steve Scalise, Cathy McMorris Rodgers and all great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!
The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill.
Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed.
Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote.
The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends, the defeated Dems, and only demean.
This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon.
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!
I would like to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on having done a fantastic job both strategically & politically on the passing in the Senate of the MASSIVE TAX CUT & Reform Bill.
I could have not asked for a better or more talented partner.
Our team will go onto many more VICTORIES!
Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
We are delivering HISTORIC TAX RELIEF for the American people!
WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves.
Companies are already making big payments to workers.
Dems want to raise taxes, hate these big Cuts!
Was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news?
You deserve it - three great people!
The many Fake News Hate Shows should study your formula for success!
Home Sales hit BEST numbers in 10 years!
House Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular, just passed, Tax Cuts.
House Republicans, don’t let this happen.
Pass the C.R. TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!
THANK YOU to everyone who joined me at the @WhiteHouse yesterday.
Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses.
This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage.
Merry Christmas!
So true!
At some point, and for the good of the country, I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion.
Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start.
After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country!
With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman’s Record), Regulation Cutting, Judicial Appointments, Building Military, VA, TAX CUTS & REFORM, Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more, I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office.
Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
The Dems only want to raise your taxes!
Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida.
He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!
The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional Sanctions on North Korea.
The World wants Peace, not Death!
Today, it was my great honor to sign the largest TAX CUTS and reform in the history of our country.
Remember, the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate, which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill.
How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits.!!!
Wow, “FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned,” according to @FoxNews.
The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low.
So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year.
Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!
Remember, the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year.
In Senate, I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost.
Virginia candidate was not a “Trumper,” and he lost.
Good Republican candidates will win BIG!
@FoxNews-FBI’s Andrew McCabe, “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign.
You obviously cannot do this.
These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton”.
The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is.
They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News.
Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Tax Cut/Reform Bill, including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had.
Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...
and our insider Polls are strong!
People are proud to be saying Merry Christmas again.
I am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
I hope everyone is having a great Christmas, then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!
Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill, which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare, the Democrats & Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!
WOW, @foxandfrlends  “Dossier is bogus.
Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier.
FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION.
FBI TAINTED”.
And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!
All signs are that business is looking really good for next year, only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill.
Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS!
Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS!
Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H. Anna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb to Court of St James’s & a big fundraiser for CH, is beside herself in grief & begging for forgiveness!
Retail sales are at record numbers.
We’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!
Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea.
There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!
I've been saying it for a long, long time.
Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record.
Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against.
Bundle up!
While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec...
and this despite massive negative Trump coverage & Russia hoax!
Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?
Should be charging MUCH MORE!
The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc.
We must protect our Country at all cost!
Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption & its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad.
Iranian govt should respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves.
The world is watching!
The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most....
Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice.
The world is watching!
On Taxes: “This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever, going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.
This is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy.
Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow.
Now real economics and jobs”.
I use Social Media not because I like to, but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair “press,” now often referred to as Fake News Media.
Phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever.
Many stories & reports a pure fiction!
Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut, and it will only get better.
MUCH MORE TO COME!
Big protests in Iran.
The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism.
Looks like they will not take it any longer.
The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!
If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day.
Now they have a great future - and just beginning!
Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election.
People are much better off now not to mention ISIS, VA, Judges, Strong Border, 2nd A, Tax Cuts & more?
My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff, and their families.
We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all!
What a year it’s been, and we're just getting started.
Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Happy New Year!!
Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate.
Not good!
As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and much faster than anyone thought possible!
The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.
They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help.
No more!
Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration.
The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years.
They are hungry for food & for freedom.
Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted.
TIME FOR CHANGE!
Will be leaving Florida for Washington (D.C.) today at 4:00 P.M. Much work to be done, but it will be a great New Year!
The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime.
All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets”.
The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights.
The U.S. is watching!
Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols.
She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents.
Remember sailors pictures on submarine?
Jail!
Deep State Justice Dept must finally act?
Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for your kind words on how well we are doing at the Border.
We will be bringing in more & more of your great folks and will build the desperately needed WALL!
Companies are giving big bonuses to their workers because of the Tax Cut Bill.
Really great!
Sanctions and “other” pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea.
Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea.
Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time.
Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!
Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation.
Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!
The Failing New York Times has a new publisher, A.G. Sulzberger.
Congratulations!
Here is a last chance for the Times to fulfill the vision of its Founder, Adolph Ochs, “to give the news impartially, without fear or FAVOR, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved”.
Get .
impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!
Democrats are doing nothing for DACA - just interested in politics.
DACA activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems, will start “falling in love” with Republicans and their President!
We are about RESULTS.
We will not rest until all of America’s GREAT VETERANS can receive the care they so richly deserve.
Tremendous progress has been made in a short period of time.
Keep up the great work @SecShulkin @DeptVetAffairs!
Congratulations to Senator Orrin Hatch on an absolutely incredible career.
He has been a tremendous supporter, and I will never forget the (beyond kind) statements he has made about me as President.
He is my friend and he will be greatly missed in the U.S. Senate!
It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others.
As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.
They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel.
We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more.
But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?
North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times”.
Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!
I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock.
Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media.
Stay tuned!
Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government.
You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!
Melania and I are deeply saddened by the death of Thomas S. Monson, a beloved President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints...
Stock Market had another good day but, now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed, we have tremendous upward potential.
Dow just short of 25,000, a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration.
Also, unemployment went down to 4.1%.
Only getting better!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud.
They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally.
As Americans, you need identification, sometimes in a very strong and accurate form, for almost everything you do.....
except when it comes to the most important thing, VOTING for the people that run your country.
Push hard for Voter Identification!
With all of the failed “experts” weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total “might” against the North.
Fools, but talks are a good thing!
So beautiful....
Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel!
Dow just crashes through 25,000.
Congrats!
Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.
Thank you to the great Republican Senators who showed up to our mtg on immigration reform.
We must BUILD THE WALL, stop illegal immigration, end chain migration & cancel the visa lottery.
The current system is unsafe & unfair to the great people of our country - time for change!
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!
I never spoke to him for book.
Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist.
Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!
The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U.S. is booming...
but the people know!
Can you imagine if “O” was president and had these numbers - would be biggest story on earth!
Dow now over 25,000.
Dow goes from 18,589 on November 9, 2016, to 25,075 today, for a new all-time Record.
Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history.
This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda!
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.
Six trillion dollars in value created!
Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable.
They should try winning an election.
Sad!
The Mercer Family recently dumped the leaker known as Sloppy Steve Bannon.
Smart!
Good idea Rand!
Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book.
He used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job.
Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone.
Too bad!
The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8%, the lowest rate in 45 years.
I am so happy about this News!
And, in the Washington Post (of all places), headline states, “Trumps first year jobs numbers were very, very good”.
Brian Ross, the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the Stock Market down 350 points (billions of dollars), was suspended for a month but is now back at ABC NEWS in a lower capacity.
He is no longer allowed to report on Trump.
Should have been fired!
Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence ctually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.
Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames.
I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star o President of the United States (on my first try).
I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius....
and a very stable genius at that!
Leaving Camp David for the White House.
Great meetings with the Cabinet and Military on many very important subjects including Border Security & the desperately needed Wall, the ever increasing Drug and Opioid Problem, Infrastructure, Military, Budget, Trade and DACA.
I’ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President.
Now I have to put up with a Fake Book, written by a totally discredited author.
Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well.
So will I!
Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration.
Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!
The Fake News Awards, those going to the most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media, will be presented to the losers on Wednesday, January 17th, rather than this coming Monday.
The interest in, and importance of, these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated!
The Stock Market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only Record Setting Stock Prices, but present and future Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.
Seven TRILLION dollars of value created since our big election win!
African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country.
The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history.
Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!
Can’t wait to be back in the amazing state of Tennessee to address the 99th American @FarmBureau Federation’s Annual Convention in Nashville!
We have been working every day to DELIVER for America’s Farmers just as they work every day to deliver FOR US.
In every decision we make, we are honoring America’s PROUD FARMING LEGACY.
Years of crushing taxes, crippling regs, & corrupt politics left our communities hurting, our economy stagnant, & millions of hardworking Americans COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN.
But they are not forgotten ANYMORE!
We are fighting for our farmers, for our country, and for our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG.
We want our flag respected - and we want our NATIONAL ANTHEM respected also!
On behalf of the American people, THANK YOU to our incredible law enforcement officers.
As President of the United States - I will fight for you, and I will never, ever let you down.
Now, more than ever, we must support the men and women in blue!
It was my great honor to sign H.R. 267, the “Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park Act,” which redesignates the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in the State of Georgia as the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park.
Thanks to all of the Republican and Democratic lawmakers for today’s very productive meeting on immigration reform.
There was strong agreement to negotiate a bill that deals with border security, chain migration, lottery and DACA.
Today, it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life.
We must ensure that our HEROES are given the care and support they so richly deserve!
As I made very clear today, our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval.
Thank you @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy!
Couldn’t agree w/you more..
@ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers, on behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow American’s SAFE.
Everyone is so grateful!
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace.
Must have tough Primary!
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues.
There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes.
Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing.
Republicans should finally take control!
I want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country.
Together, we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Today, it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the @WhiteHouse - a great friend and ally of the United States!
The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval.
Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest!
Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 JOBS and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama, helping to further grow our economy!
Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville, Alabama, plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and SUV’s a year and employ 4000 people.
Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way.
Congratulations Alabama!
Disproven and paid for by Democrats “Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign.
Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?
” @foxandfriends  Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians?
Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers?
Where are Crooked Hillary Emails?
What a mess!
In new Quinnipiac Poll, 66% of people feel the economy is “Excellent or Good”.
That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.
With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land.
We need it!
Get smart!
Great news, as a result of our TAX CUTS & JOBS ACT!
Thank you Adam Levine, The Federalist, in interview on @foxandfriends  “Donald Trump is the greatest President our Country has ever seen”.
Small Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history.
All business is just at the beginning of something really special!
More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform: Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant, relocating their heavy-truck production from Mexico to Michigan, adding 2,500 new jobs and paying $2,000 bonus to U.S. employees!
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan, reversing a years long opposite trend.
Thank you Chrysler, a very wise decision.
The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence.
Plenty of more to follow!
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization.
Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal.
She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!
The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process.
It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans.
We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery & Chain.
USA!
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars.
Bad deal.
Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!
The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards.
Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime ountries which are doing badly.
I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level.
I want safety and security for our people.
I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs.
I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards.
The Dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most.
Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used.
What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!
Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA.
Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST!
Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country.
Never said “take them out”.
Made up by Dems.
I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians.
Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!
Today, it was my great honor to proclaim January 15, 2018, as Martin Luther King Jr., Federal Holiday.
I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy.
Yesterday was a big day for the stock market.
Jobs are coming back to America.
Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow.
Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing.
American business is hot again!
The Democrats are all talk and no action.
They are doing nothing to fix DACA.
Great opportunity missed.
Too bad!
AMERICA FIRST!
Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market.
Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees.
If Dems won in November, Market would have TANKED!
It was headed for disaster.
I don’t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA.
They are all talk and no action.
This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have.
Too bad!
So much Fake News is being reported.
They don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong.
They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information.
The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!
The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N. Korea).
Obviously I didn’t say that.
I said “I’d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,” a big difference.
Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters and they knew exactly what I said and meant.
They just wanted a story.
FAKE NEWS!
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.
I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT.
No more Lotteries!
